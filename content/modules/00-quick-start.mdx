## ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY NOTICE

<SafetyFlag 
  type="critical"
  message="The order of this protocol matters. Skipping steps can make you severely ill. NEVER start binders while constipated or without proper drainage - this is the #1 mistake that causes severe reactions. You need 2-4 weeks of drainage preparation first."
/>

## Module Overview

This is your emergency protocol. If you've just discovered mold exposure or tested positive for mycotoxins, start here. These 5 critical lessons can mean the difference between rapid recovery and months of unnecessary suffering.

> **Kajsa's Corner:** "I unknowingly spent years in a house filled with mold. It started slowly - unusual fatigue, then brain fog, vertigo, and rashes. Doctors had no answers. I wish I'd had this emergency protocol when I first discovered the mold. It would have saved me from making the mistakes that made me much sicker."

<DoThisNow 
  title="Start Right Now"
  action="You need to act within 24-48 hours of discovering mold exposure. The longer you wait, the sicker you'll get. Begin with Lesson 1 immediately."
  urgency="critical"
/>

## What You'll Learn

This module contains 5 emergency lessons that must be completed in order:

### Lesson 1: Stop Exposure NOW (5 min)
Immediate steps to cease all mold exposure, document everything for legal/medical purposes, and safely evacuate if necessary.

### Lesson 2: Quick Environmental Assessment (5 min)
Rapid evaluation of your home, car, and workplace to identify all exposure sources and determine if professional help is needed.

### Lesson 3: Basic Symptom Tracking (5 min)
Document your symptoms properly for medical appointments, insurance claims, and to track your recovery progress.

### Lesson 4: Understanding Binders - Don't Start Yet! (10 min)
**CRITICAL:** Learn why starting binders too early is dangerous and what to do instead for the first 2-4 weeks.

### Lesson 5: Finding Help Fast (5 min)
Connect with mold-literate doctors, support groups, and resources immediately - you shouldn't do this alone.

## The Protocol That Works

<div className="bg-emerald-50 p-6 rounded-lg mb-6">
  <h3 className="font-bold text-emerald-900 mb-3">Your Emergency Timeline</h3>
  
  **Day 1 (Today):**
  - Document all mold with photos/videos
  - Pack essentials and leave if necessary
  - Start basic symptom tracking
  - Find temporary safe housing
  
  **Days 2-3:**
  - Complete environmental assessment
  - Schedule mold-literate doctor
  - Join support groups
  - Begin drainage support (magnesium, hydration, vitamin C)
  
  **Weeks 1-4:**
  - Continue drainage preparation
  - NO BINDERS YET (critical for safety)
  - Get mycotoxin testing
  - Implement Module 03 drainage protocol
  
  **Week 5+:**
  - Start binders ONLY after 80% drainage readiness
  - Begin Module 04 binder protocol
  - Continue with systematic recovery
</div>

## Why This Order Matters

<EvidenceBadge level="solid" />

### The #1 Mistake: Starting Binders Too Early

Most people discover mold and immediately start taking activated charcoal or other binders. This is the worst thing you can do. Here's why:

**What happens when you take binders without drainage:**
1. Binders grab toxins in your gut
2. Without open drainage, toxins can't exit
3. Toxins get reabsorbed at higher concentrations
4. You experience severe "retoxification"
5. Emergency room visits become common

**Real consequences we've seen:**
- Seizures and tremors
- Psychiatric symptoms
- Kidney and liver stress
- Bedridden for weeks
- Recovery setback by months

<SafetyFlag 
  type="critical"
  message="75% of people who start binders immediately end up in crisis. The 2-4 week drainage preparation isn't optional - it's the difference between recovery and disaster."
/>

## What Makes This Different

### Traditional Approach (Dangerous)
❌ Find mold → Start binders immediately → Get severely sick → Stop all treatment → Stay sick for months

### Our Protocol (Safe & Effective)
✅ Find mold → Stop exposure → Open drainage (2-4 weeks) → Start binders slowly → Systematic recovery
