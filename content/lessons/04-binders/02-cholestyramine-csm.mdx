# Cholestyramine (CSM) - The Gold Standard
*The most effective protocol for mycotoxin removal*

<EvidenceBadge level="solid" />

## What is Cholestyramine?

**Cholestyramine (CSM) facts:**
- Generic names: Cholestyramine resin
- Brand names: Questran, Questran Light, Prevalite
- Original use: Cholesterol reduction
- Mold use: Discovered by Dr. Ritchie Shoemaker
- FDA status: Approved (for cholesterol)
- Prescription: Required

**Why it's the gold standard:**
- Binds widest range of mycotoxins
- Most research and clinical evidence
- Predictable results
- Safe for long-term use
- Thousands of success stories

<SafetyFlag 
  type="critical"
  message="You MUST have completed Module 03 and achieved 80% drainage readiness for 7 consecutive days before starting CSM. Starting too early causes severe retoxification."
/>

## Getting Your Prescription

### Telehealth Script for Doctors

<DoThisNow 
  title="What to Tell Your Doctor"
  action="I've been exposed to a water-damaged building with confirmed mold growth. I'm following the Shoemaker Protocol for Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS). I need cholestyramine for bile acid sequestration to bind and eliminate mycotoxins. I understand this is off-label use and accept responsibility."
  urgency="high"
/>

### Finding Prescribers

**Best options:**
1. **SurvivingMold.com Certified**
   - Understand the protocol
   - Most offer telehealth
   - No convincing needed

2. **Environmental Medicine Doctors**

   - Often prescribe CSM

3. **Functional Medicine**
   - IFM.org practitioner search
   - More open to off-label use
   - May require education

4. **Direct Primary Care**
   - Monthly membership model
   - More time with patients
   - Often willing to research

### If Doctor Refuses

**Provide evidence:**
- Shoemaker's published papers
- GAO report on mold illness
- Your mycotoxin test results
- Your environmental test results

**Alternative approaches:**
- Offer to sign informed consent

- Learning routine

**Months 3-4:**
- Full therapeutic dose
- Significant improvement begins
- Energy returning
- Brain fog clearing

**Months 5-6:**
- Continued improvement
- May add other interventions
- Consider retesting
- Evaluate progress

**Beyond 6 months:**
- Some need 9-12+ months
- Depends on exposure severity
- Genetic factors (HLA-DR)
- Environmental factors

### When You're Done

**Tapering protocol:**

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "I Can't Handle the Taste"

**Solutions:**
- Try pure CSM from compounding pharmacy
- Use applesauce method
- Take as quick shot with juice
- Use flavored water enhancers (check ingredients)
- Consider Welchol if truly intolerable

### "Severe Constipation"

**Immediate fixes:**
- Increase magnesium to 800-1200mg
- Add vitamin C to bowel tolerance
- Use Smooth Move tea
- Try coffee enemas
- Reduce dose temporarily

### "Extreme Fatigue"

**This indicates:**
- Mobilization occurring (good!)
- May be going too fast
- Need more drainage support

**Actions:**
- Reduce dose by half
- Increase binder frequency (smaller doses)
- Add activated charcoal between CSM doses
- Rest more, gentle movement only

## Your CSM Success Checklist

<DoThisNow 
  title="This Week's CSM Action Steps"
  action="1. Get prescription (use telehealth if needed)
2. Order from compounding pharmacy
3. Buy fat-soluble vitamins
4. Set up dosing schedule with alarms
5. Prepare mixing supplies
6. Start with ¼ scoop twice daily"

## Next Steps

Once you're stable on CSM (usually 2-4 weeks), continue to **Lesson 3: Welchol Alternative** to learn about combination protocols and alternatives for those who can't tolerate CSM.

Remember: CSM is the most effective tool we have for removing mycotoxins. The temporary discomfort is worth the long-term recovery.
