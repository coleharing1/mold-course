## The Final Phase: Eliminating Fungal Colonization

After 2-4 weeks on binders, it's time to address potential fungal colonization in your body. Antifungals kill mold and fungi that may be growing in your sinuses, gut, or lungs, stopping them from producing more mycotoxins.

> **⚠️ Gate Check:** Have you been on binders for at least 2 weeks and tolerating them well? If not, return to Module 05.

## Why Antifungals Matter

### The Colonization Problem
Mold doesn't just produce toxins - it can actually colonize (grow inside) your body:
- **Sinuses:** Most common site
- **Gut:** Candida and mold overgrowth
- **Lungs:** In severe cases
- **Skin:** Fungal infections

Without antifungals, colonized mold continues producing mycotoxins even after environmental exposure ends.

### When to Add Antifungals

**Start antifungals when:**
✅ Been on binders 2-4 weeks  
✅ Drainage pathways remain open  
✅ Tolerating binders well  
✅ Still having fungal symptoms  

**Fungal symptoms include:**
- Chronic sinus issues
- Persistent brain fog
- Skin rashes/fungal infections
- Digestive issues
- Sugar cravings
- Persistent fatigue

## Itraconazole: The Prescription Powerhouse

### Why Itraconazole?
- **Broad spectrum** - kills many mold species
- **Systemic action** - reaches all body tissues
- **Proven effective** for mold illness
- **Well-studied** safety profile
- **Results in weeks** not months

### Getting Itraconazole

#### Brand Names
- **Sporanox** (brand)
- **Itraconazole** (generic)
- **Tolsura** (newer formulation)

#### How to Get Prescribed

**Telehealth approach:**
1. Use same service that prescribed CSM
2. Show mycotoxin test results
3. Explain you need antifungal for mold
4. Request 2-month supply

**Script for doctor:**
"I've been on binders for [X weeks] for mycotoxin illness. My tests show [specific molds]. I'd like to add Itraconazole to address potential fungal colonization, following established mold illness protocols."

### Itraconazole Protocol

#### Standard Adult Dosing
**Loading Phase (Week 1):**
- 200mg twice daily with food
