# Mold Detox Mastery - Detailed Course Structure
## Based on Kajsa's Proven Protocol

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY NOTICE
**The order of this protocol matters. Skipping steps can make you severely ill.**
1. **STOP EXPOSURE FIRST** - You cannot heal in mold
2. **OPEN DRAINAGE PATHWAYS** - 2-4 weeks minimum before any binders
3. **START BINDERS SLOWLY** - Only after achieving 80% drainage readiness for 7 days
4. **ADD ANTIFUNGALS** - Only if needed, after stable on binders

**Never start binders while constipated or without proper drainage - this is the #1 mistake that causes severe reactions.**
