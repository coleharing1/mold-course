awesome—let’s turn your PDF into a clean, credible micro‑course that feels guided and interactive (no facecam needed). below is a battle‑tested structure, the pages to build, and the exact features that make it feel premium vs “just a download.” I’ve aligned the curriculum to the sections already in your guide (quick start, testing, drainage → binders → antifungals, modalities, diet, resources, FAQ), so you can repurpose content fast.&#x20;

# Product vision

A self‑paced, tool‑driven course with short audio “micro‑lessons,” interactive checklists, decision helpers, and auto‑generated plans. Think: *click → get a step, a checklist, and a tracker*, not “watch 50 minutes.”

# Core pages (and what makes each valuable)

1. **Landing/Sales page**

   * Promise + transformation; credibility + medical disclaimer; “What you’ll build: Your personalized detox plan in 60 minutes.”
   * Sections: outcomes, who it’s for/not for, curriculum snapshot, tool previews, FAQs, refund policy, legal/medical disclaimer (gated acknowledgment on purchase). Your PDF already includes a clear medical disclaimer—surface and require acceptance here.&#x20;

2. **Onboarding Wizard (5–7 minutes)**

   * Collect: living situation (suspected exposure), current symptoms, prior tests, budget constraints, equipment access (sauna/filters), food constraints.
   * Output: a personalized *Starter Plan* (modules pre‑highlighted, suggested pace, tool shortcuts).

3. **Curriculum hub**

   * Modules (mapped to your guide):
     0\. Quick Start (the 5 steps) → turns into checklists + readiness gates.&#x20;

     1. Identify Exposure (home/work/car)
     2. Testing & Diagnosis (environmental + medical, with cautions & alternatives)&#x20;
     3. Open Drainage Pathways (bowel, liver, lymph, kidneys, sweat) → interactive trackers.&#x20;
     4. Detox Phase I: Binders (dosage timing, interactions, side‑effect guardrails).&#x20;
     5. Detox Phase II: Antifungals (when/if, monitoring, talk‑to‑your‑doctor prompts).&#x20;
     6. Managing Herx (intensity slider → suggested adjustments).&#x20;
     7. Supportive Modalities (sauna, strength, nasal care, sleep) with safe‑use cards.&#x20;
     8. Diet & Pantry (low‑mold, low‑amylose plan + shopping list generator).&#x20;
     9. Long‑term Prevention & Retesting (schedules, home habits, re‑exposure playbook).&#x20;

4. **Lesson page template (reused everywhere)**

   * TL;DR up top → 3–7 minute audio clip → one diagram → “Do this now” checklist → tool links → notes → evidence level tag (Solid / Emerging / Controversial) → safety flags.

5. **Tools library** (the real “value beyond PDF”)

   * See “Interactive tools” list below.

6. **Your Plan**

   * Auto‑assembled, step‑by‑step timeline (weeks 1–4 drainage, 5–8 binders, etc.), with your current completion, next action, and calendar buttons. Mirrors your timeline and phaseing from the guide.&#x20;

7. **Progress dashboard**

   * Symptom trend (user logs), bowel/sweat/hydration streaks, binder adherence, “readiness” score to unlock next phase, retesting countdown (VCS + urine panel).&#x20;

8. **Resources vault**

   * Curated products/equipment list (neutral language, affiliate‑safe), email templates (landlord/inspector/doctor), printable room‑by‑room audit, shopping lists, travel checklist. Your existing resource lists and product categories seed this.&#x20;

9. **FAQ + Myth/Fact center**

   * Pull Qs from your PDF FAQ; add evidence‑level badges and “when to see a clinician” banners.&#x20;

10. **Legal & safety**

* Medical disclaimer page (user must accept before accessing certain lessons) + content provenance (what’s based on your experience vs. established guidance). Your guide’s disclaimer anchors this.&#x20;

# Interactive tools to build (where the magic happens)

* **Dampness & Exposure Checklist** → room‑by‑room score; outputs “Fix first” list and inspector brief.&#x20;
* **Testing Decision Helper** → suggests *environmental vs medical* options, cost ranges, and caveats; prints a “talk with your clinician” sheet.&#x20;
* **Drainage Readiness Score** → daily input for bowels/hydration/sweat/lymph; must hit green before binders module unlocks.&#x20;
* **Binder Timing Planner** → schedules doses around meals/meds, flags fat‑soluble vitamin timing, generates calendar events.&#x20;
* **Herx Toolkit** → user sets current intensity; tool suggests slow‑down steps (spacing doses, extra hydration, sauna adjustments) and when to contact a clinician.&#x20;
* **Sauna Ramp‑Up** → heat/time progression with hydration reminders and post‑sauna rinse checklist.&#x20;
* **Diet Builder** → 7‑day low‑mold plan + grocery list printable; warns on common high‑mold foods.&#x20;
* **Retesting Scheduler** → VCS every \~3 months, urine panel at 3–6 months; tracks when to order and how to compare.&#x20;
* **Re‑Exposure Triage** → “I think I got exposed” flow → immediate steps, optional short binder pulse, and home checks (educational, not medical advice).&#x20;

# Formats (no face on camera)

* **Audio micro‑lessons** (3–7 min) over clean slides (screen recording), or AI voice over motion slides.
* **Diagrams + annotated protocols** instead of long videos.
* **Interactive checklists** and “mini‑quizzes” to unlock next steps.
* **Downloadables**: one‑page cheatsheets for each phase.

# Suggested build (Cursor‑friendly)

**Front‑end:** Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
**Content:** MDX for lessons; Contentlayer to map MDX to typed models
**Auth/DB:** Supabase (auth, Postgres, row‑level security)
**Payments:** Stripe (one‑time + optional upgrade)
**State:** React Hook Form + Zod validation for tools/wizards
**Email:** Resend/Postal for receipts and nudges
**Video/Audio:** slide screen‑captures hosted on Bunny or Mux; audio MP3s downloadable
**Analytics:** PostHog for funnels and tool usage

**Folder shape**

**Minimal data models**

* `User`: id, onboarding profile (environment, symptoms, equipment)
* `Progress`: userId, moduleId, status, lastActionAt
* `SymptomLog`: date, fatigue, brainFog, etc. (1–10)
* `Readiness`: userId, drainageScore (computed rolling 7‑day), binderUnlocked boolean
* `ToolState`: per‑tool JSON blob (planner times, shopping list)

# Pedagogy & gating

* **Level locks:** Drainage module must reach a readiness threshold (e.g., 7‑day green streak) before binders tools unlock.
* **“Do this now” on every lesson:** One action only.
* **Badges:** Drainage unlocked; First week clear; Retest booked; Herx managed.
* **Evidence labeling:** Tag lesson sections as Solid / Emerging / Controversial so learners understand confidence levels.

# Packaging & pricing

* **Core (\$149–\$199):** Full curriculum + tools + updates.
* **Pro (\$249–\$349):** Core + resource vault templates + diet builder + retesting scheduler + plan exports.
* **Premium (\$449–\$699):** Pro + quarterly live audio Q\&A (no video) + priority email support.

# Compliance & safety

* Gate access with a required **medical disclaimer acceptance** (you’ve already written one—reuse it verbatim as the first step). Add “educational only” banners on pages that reference prescriptions or lab tests, and always surface “talk to your clinician” calls‑to‑action.&#x20;

# How your existing PDF maps directly to modules/tools

* **Quick‑Start steps** → Module 0 + interactive checklist.&#x20;
* **Testing types & flow** → Testing Helper + Retesting Scheduler.&#x20;
* **Drainage → Binders → Antifungals timeline** → gating logic + Planner tools.&#x20;
* **Herx management & Modalities (sauna, strength, nasal care, sleep)** → Herx Toolkit + Sauna Ramp‑Up.&#x20;
* **Diet section & food risks** → Diet Builder + Grocery List.&#x20;
* **Resources & FAQ** → Resources vault + searchable FAQ center.&#x20;

if you want, I can draft a ready‑to‑paste **site map + MDX lesson skeletons** for the first three modules (Quick Start, Exposure, Testing) along with the **Drainage Readiness** tool spec so you can drop it straight into Cursor and scaffold the project today.
