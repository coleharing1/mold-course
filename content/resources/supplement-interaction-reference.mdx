## Major Drug-Supplement Interactions

### Blood Thinners (Warfarin, Heparin, etc.)
**Avoid or Monitor Closely:**
- **Vitamin E** (>400 IU daily) - Increases bleeding risk
- **Fish Oil** (>3g daily) - May enhance anticoagulation
- **Garlic supplements** - Can increase bleeding
- **Ginkgo biloba** - Potentiates blood thinning
- **NAC** - May affect clotting factors

**Safe with monitoring:**
- Vitamin C, B-complex, probiotics
- Magnesium (monitor if on heart medications)

### Thyroid Medications (Levothyroxine, etc.)
**Separate by 4+ hours:**
- **Calcium** - Reduces thyroid hormone absorption
- **Iron** - Decreases medication effectiveness
- **Fiber supplements** - Can interfere with absorption
- **Coffee/caffeine** - Take medication first, then wait 1 hour

**Generally safe:**
- B-vitamins, Vitamin D, zinc (taken separately)

### Diabetes Medications
**Monitor blood sugar closely:**
- **Chromium** - May enhance insulin sensitivity
- **Alpha-lipoic acid** - Can lower blood glucose
- **Magnesium** - May improve insulin function
- **Berberine** - Significant glucose-lowering effects

**Contraindicated:**
- High-dose vitamin C (may affect glucose readings)

### Blood Pressure Medications
**Use caution:**
- **Magnesium** - May enhance hypotensive effects
- **CoQ10** - Can lower blood pressure
- **Garlic** - May reduce blood pressure
- **Potassium** - Risk of hyperkalemia with ACE inhibitors

### Immunosuppressants
**Avoid immune-stimulating supplements:**
- **Echinacea** - May counteract immunosuppression
- **Astragalus** - Immune stimulating
- **Medicinal mushrooms** - May boost immune function
- **High-dose vitamin C** - Immune enhancing

## Supplement-to-Supplement Interactions

### Absorption Conflicts

#### Iron vs. Other Minerals
**Iron reduces absorption of:**
- Calcium (separate by 2+ hours)
- Zinc (compete for same transporters)
- Magnesium (mutual interference)
- Copper (though some copper needed for iron utilization)

**Iron absorption reduced by:**
- Calcium, magnesium, zinc
- Tea, coffee (tannins)
- High-fiber foods

#### Calcium Interactions
**Calcium interferes with:**
- Iron absorption (major interaction)
- Zinc absorption (moderate)
- Magnesium absorption (take separately)
- Thyroid medications (4+ hour separation)

**Best taken:**
- Away from other minerals
- With vitamin D for absorption
- In divided doses (≤500mg at a time)

#### Zinc Interactions
**Zinc competes with:**
- Iron (separate by 2+ hours)
- Copper (zinc can deplete copper over time)
- Calcium (moderate interference)

**Zinc enhanced by:**
- Protein-rich meals
- Vitamin A
- Away from fiber

### Fat-Soluble Vitamin Interactions

#### Vitamin A, D, E, K
**Take together:**
- All fat-soluble vitamins can be taken with fats
- Best absorbed with meals containing fat

**Cautions:**
- High-dose vitamin E may interfere with vitamin K
- Vitamin A and D can be toxic in high doses
- Monitor levels with blood tests if taking high doses

### B-Vitamin Interactions
**Synergistic effects:**
- B-vitamins work together - take as complex
- Individual high doses may deplete others
- Folate and B12 work together

**Timing:**
- Take in morning (can be energizing)
- With food to reduce nausea
- Avoid evening doses (may interfere with sleep)

## Mold Detox Specific Interactions

### Binder Interactions (CRITICAL)

#### Cholestyramine (CSM)
**Must separate by 2+ hours from:**
- **ALL medications** (can bind and reduce effectiveness)
- **ALL supplements** (fat-soluble vitamins especially)
- **Probiotics** (wait 4+ hours minimum)

**Timing strategy:**
- Take CSM away from meals
- Take other supplements/medications 2+ hours before or 4+ hours after
- Monitor for medication effectiveness changes

#### Activated Charcoal
**Binds almost everything:**
- Separate from ALL medications by 2+ hours minimum
- Can bind nutrients and supplements
- Use sparingly and with professional guidance
- Drink extra water to prevent constipation

#### Clay Binders (Bentonite, Zeolite)
**Less aggressive than CSM but still significant:**
- Separate from medications by 1-2 hours
- May bind some nutrients
- Take with plenty of water
- Monitor bowel movements

### Detox Support Combinations

#### Liver Support Stack
**Synergistic combinations:**
- **Milk thistle + NAC + Glutathione** - Comprehensive liver support
- **Alpha-lipoic acid + vitamin E** - Antioxidant synergy
- **B-complex + magnesium** - Detox pathway support

**Timing:**
- Take liver support away from binders
- Best on empty stomach or light meal
- Divide doses throughout day

#### Drainage Support
**Complementary supplements:**
- **Magnesium + potassium** - Electrolyte balance
- **Vitamin C + bioflavonoids** - Enhanced absorption
- **Probiotics + digestive enzymes** - Gut health synergy
