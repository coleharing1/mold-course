# DIY Testing Methods
*Affordable screening before investing in expensive tests*

<EvidenceBadge level="emerging" />

## Why Start with DIY Testing?

DIY testing provides affordable initial screening to determine if professional testing is needed. While not definitive, these methods can reveal obvious problems and guide your next steps.

**Benefits:**
- Low cost ($30-80 total)
- Quick results (3-7 days)
- Multiple room comparison
- Visual confirmation
- Empowering to do yourself

**Limitations:**
- Can't identify species
- No professional interpretation
- Variable accuracy
- Many false positives/negatives

## Petri Dish Placement Strategy

### The 5-Room Protocol

**Optimal placement locations:**

1. **Master Bedroom** (where you spend 8+ hours)
   - Place on nightstand
   - 3-4 feet from ground
   - Away from vents

2. **Basement** (highest moisture risk)
   - Near foundation walls
   - Close to sump pump
   - By stored items

3. **Main HVAC Vent** (tests whole-house circulation)
   - Under return air vent
   - Or near supply vent
   - Tests what's circulating

4. **Problem Area** (near past leaks/damage)
   - Bathroom under sink
   - Kitchen behind fridge
   - Any water damage spot

5. **Control Dish** (outdoor comparison)
   - Outside front door
   - Protected from rain
   - Same height as indoor plates

### Step-by-Step Protocol

**Day 1: Setup**
1. **Prepare dishes:**
   - Label with room and date
   - Use permanent marker on bottom
   - Have timer ready

2. **Exposure protocol:**
   - Open all dishes simultaneously
   - Leave open exactly 1 hour
   - Don't move or disturb
   - Note weather conditions

3. **Close and incubate:**
   - Replace lids carefully
   - Store at room temperature (68-75°F)
   - Keep in dark location
   - Don't stack dishes

**Days 2-5: Monitoring**
- Check daily without opening
- Photograph through lid
- Note growth patterns
- Count colonies each day

**Day 5: Interpretation**
- **0-3 colonies:** Normal/acceptable
- **4-10 colonies:** Elevated, investigate
- **>10 colonies:** Problematic, test further
- **Rapid growth (24-48hr):** High concern

## Tape Lift Sampling

### When to Use Tape Lifts

**Perfect for:**
- Visible mold identification
- Insurance documentation
- Before/after cleaning
- Legal evidence
- Species confirmation

### Professional Tape Lift Technique

**Materials needed:**
- Clear packing tape (not magic tape)
- Zip-lock bags
- Permanent marker
- Gloves
- N95 mask
- Ruler or coin for scale

**Step-by-step process:**

1. **Safety first:**
   - Put on N95 mask
   - Wear disposable gloves
   - Open windows if possible

2. **Document location:**
   - Photograph area first
   - Include ruler for scale
   - Note exact location

3. **Collect sample:**
   - Cut 3-inch tape piece
   - Press firmly on mold
   - Avoid touching edges
   - Lift straight up

4. **Preserve sample:**
   - Fold tape onto itself
   - Place in labeled bag
   - Include location note
   - Seal immediately

5. **Lab submission:**
   - Find local lab or mail
   - Request species identification
   - Cost: $40-80 per sample
   - Results in 3-5 days

## Gravity Plate Testing

### Extended Exposure Method

**More accurate than 1-hour petri dishes**

**Setup:**
- Use settling plates from lab supply
- Place 3-4 feet from ground
- Protected from air currents
- Leave for 1-7 days

**Exposure times:**
- **24 hours:** Quick screening
- **3 days:** Balanced approach
- **7 days:** Most comprehensive
- **14 days:** Research-grade

**Interpretation guidelines:**
- Compare to outdoor control
- Indoor should be ≤ outdoor
- Look for unusual species
- Note predominant types

### The Dust Collection Method

**For ERMI/HERTSMI-2 sampling:**

1. **Collect dust from:**
   - Top of door frames
   - Behind refrigerator
   - Ceiling fan blades
   - Window sills
   - Never vacuum bag

2. **Use provided:**
   - Swiffer cloth (from kit)
   - Collection template
   - Clean zip-lock bag

3. **Mail to lab:**
   - EnviroBiomics
   - Mycometrics
   - Results in 5-7 days

## Interpreting DIY Results

### Red Flags in Any DIY Test

**Immediate concern if you see:**
- Black/dark green fuzzy growth
- Rapid growth (within 24-48 hours)
- Slimy or wet-looking colonies
- Strong musty odor when near dishes
- Multiple colony types
- Growth pattern matching water damage areas

### Colony Appearance Guide

**Common mold characteristics:**

**Aspergillus/Penicillium:**
- Blue-green color
- Powdery texture
- Circular growth pattern
- Common but concerning

**Stachybotrys (Black Mold):**
- Dark black/green
- Slimy when wet
- Slow growing
- Extremely concerning

**Cladosporium:**
- Olive green to brown
- Velvety texture
- Very common
- Moderate concern

**Chaetomium:**
- White to gray
- Cotton-like texture
- Musty smell
- High concern

## When DIY Isn't Enough

### Upgrade to Professional Testing When:

**Health indicators:**
- Severe symptoms present
- Multiple family members sick
- Symptoms match mold exposure
- Doctor requests testing

**Environmental indicators:**
- DIY tests show high growth
- Visible mold over 10 sq ft
- Multiple problem areas
- Water damage history

**Practical needs:**
- Insurance claim
- Legal documentation
- Real estate transaction
- Workplace exposure

## Cost Comparison Chart

| Method | Cost | Time | Accuracy | Best For |
|--------|------|------|----------|----------|
| Petri Dishes | $30-50 | 5 days | Low | Initial screening |
| Tape Lifts | $40-80 | 3-5 days | Medium | Visible mold ID |
| Gravity Plates | $50-100 | 7 days | Medium | Air quality |
| Dust Collection | $155+ | 7 days | High | ERMI/HERTSMI |
| Professional | $300+ | Same day | Highest | Comprehensive |

## Common DIY Testing Mistakes

### ❌ Opening dishes after growth
Releases millions of spores - never open after closing

### ❌ Testing during remediation
Disturbed mold increases counts - test before and after only

### ❌ Ignoring outdoor controls
Indoor mold should not exceed outdoor levels significantly

### ❌ Over-interpreting results
Some mold is normal - look for unusual types and quantities

### ❌ Testing after deep cleaning
Recent cleaning reduces accuracy - wait 48 hours
