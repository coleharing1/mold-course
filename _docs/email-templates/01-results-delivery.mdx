## A Quick Personal Note

{{name}}, I know how frustrating it can be to have mysterious symptoms that doctors can't explain. I've been exactly where you are.

After spending months feeling worse on "detox" protocols, I discovered the critical missing piece: **drainage pathways must be open BEFORE you start pulling toxins out**.

This one insight changed everything for my recovery.

Over the next few days, I'll share more of my story and the exact protocol that helped me reclaim my health.

To your recovery,  
Kajsa
