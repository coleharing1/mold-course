# Complete Drainage Protocol Guide

## Overview
This comprehensive guide provides detailed protocols for optimizing all five major drainage pathways to achieve the critical 80% readiness score required before beginning binder protocols. Each pathway includes specific supplements, dosages, timing, and monitoring strategies.

## Why Drainage Matters
Before detoxing with binders, your body's elimination pathways must be functioning optimally. Poor drainage can lead to:
- Severe herxheimer reactions
- Toxin redistribution
- Increased inflammation
- Treatment failure

**Target: 80% drainage readiness for 7 consecutive days before starting binders**

## Monitoring and Adjustments

### Weekly Assessment Questions

8. What drainage percentage are you achieving?

### When to Adjust Protocol
- **Increase support** if scoring less than 70% consistently
- **Maintain current** if 70-79% with improvement trend
- **Consider advancing** if 80%+ for 7 consecutive days
- **Reduce intensity** if experiencing side effects

### Red Flags - Seek Professional Help
- Persistent constipation despite intervention
- Decreased urination or kidney pain
- Significant swelling or lymph node enlargement
- Severe fatigue or mood changes
- Any concerning symptoms
