# Vehicle Contamination
*The mobile mold source you drive every day*

<EvidenceBadge level="solid" />

## The Overlooked Exposure Source

Your car might be sabotaging your health recovery. Many people clean up their homes perfectly but continue exposure through their vehicles. Consider this:

- You spend **1-3 hours daily** in your car
- Vehicle AC systems are **perfect mold incubators**
- **90% of people** never check their cabin air filter
- Car mold exposure happens at **close range** (directly inhaled)
- Vehicle contamination often **re-contaminates clean clothes and belongings**

<SafetyFlag 
  type="warning"
  message="Vehicle mold can be more concentrated than home mold because it's in a small, enclosed space. If you smell mold in your car, address it immediately - you're breathing it at high concentrations."
/>

## Why Cars Develop Mold Problems

### **Perfect Storm Conditions:**
1. **Moisture Source**: AC condensation, wet shoes/clothes, spilled drinks
2. **Warm Environment**: Parked in sun, engine heat
3. **Organic Materials**: Fabric seats, carpets, paper items
4. **Poor Ventilation**: Sealed environment when parked
5. **Temperature Fluctuations**: Daily hot/cool cycles create condensation

### **Common Contamination Events:**
- **Flood damage** (even minor flooding)
- **Sunroof leaks** or window seals failing
- **AC drain clogs** causing interior water backup
- **Wet items** left in car (umbrellas, towels, gym clothes)
- **Food spills** that aren't completely cleaned
- **Pet accidents** or wet pets in car

## The AC System: Mold Central

Your car's AC system is the most likely place for mold growth and the most dangerous because it blows contaminated air directly at you.

### **How Car AC Systems Develop Mold:**
1. **Condensation** forms on cold evaporator coils
2. **Moisture collects** in drain pan and ducts
3. **Mold spores** enter through outside air
4. **Growth begins** in dark, moist environment
5. **Contaminated air** circulates throughout cabin

### **AC System Inspection Protocol:**

#### **The Smell Test:**
1. **Car off, windows closed** for 30+ minutes
2. **Turn on AC** to maximum cold
3. **Switch to recirculate** mode
4. **Smell carefully** - musty = mold problem
5. **Test different settings** (heat, defrost, vent positions)

#### **Visual AC Inspection:**
<ChecklistComponent title="AC System Check Points" items={[
  "Remove cabin air filter (usually behind glove box)",
  "Inspect filter for black/green discoloration",
  "Check filter housing for moisture or mold",
  "Look at AC vents for visible contamination",
  "Inspect evaporator drain tube under car",
  "Check for water pooling under parked car",
  "Examine AC controls for moisture buildup",
  "Test if musty smell is stronger on recirculate vs fresh air"

- **Re-exposure** undoing home remediation progress
- **Continued symptoms** despite clean home environment

### **Integration with Overall Protocol:**
Vehicle mold remediation should happen **simultaneously** with home remediation, not after. A moldy car can re-contaminate a clean home and continue health impacts.

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### **Professional Vehicle Treatment:**
- **Cost**: $200-600 typically
- **Benefit**: Eliminates daily exposure source
- **Timeline**: 1-2 days
- **Success Rate**: 85-95% for surface mold

### **Vehicle Replacement:**
- **Consider if**: Treatment costs approach vehicle value
- **Flood-damaged vehicles**: Often not worth remediation
- **Extensive contamination**: May be more cost-effective
