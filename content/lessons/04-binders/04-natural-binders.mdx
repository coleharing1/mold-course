# Natural Binders - Non-Prescription Options
*Accessible alternatives and supportive binding agents*

<EvidenceBadge level="emerging" />

## Understanding Natural Binders

### Why Consider Natural Options?

**Primary reasons:**
- No prescription needed
- Generally affordable
- Fewer side effects
- Can start immediately
- Good for maintenance
- Travel-friendly

**Best used for:**
- Mild exposure
- Budget constraints
- CSM/Welchol intolerance
- Additional support
- Maintenance phase
- Prevention

**Limitations to understand:**
- Less research evidence
- Lower binding capacity
- More selective binding
- Slower results
- May need combinations

<SafetyFlag 
  type="info"
  message="Natural binders are typically 10-30% as effective as CSM. They work best as adjuncts to prescription binders or in combination with each other."

## Activated Charcoal

### The Universal Binder

**What it is:**
- Carbon processed at high temperatures
- Creates massive surface area
- Non-selective binding
- Used in emergency poisoning
- Available everywhere

**Binding profile:**
- Good for: Ochratoxin, aflatoxins
- Moderate for: Trichothecenes
- Poor for: Large molecules
- Also binds: Medications, nutrients

### Dosing Protocols

- Away from supplements
- Plenty of water
- Cycle on/off monthly

<SafetyFlag 
  type="warning"
  message="Zeolite is controversial. Some practitioners avoid it entirely due to potential redistribution of toxins. Others find it helpful. Proceed with caution."
