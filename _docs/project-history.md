## 2025-08-11 - Module Content Restructuring to Two-Tier System

### Summary
Major restructuring of module content architecture to implement a two-tier system with module overviews and separate lesson files. Completed Module 00 and Module 02 restructuring, creating 11 new lesson files with proper frontmatter and safety-focused content. Fixed critical safety issues in Module 00 that incorrectly promoted immediate binder use.

### Critical Safety Fix in Module 00
**Problem Discovered:**
- Module 00 originally had "Emergency Binder Protocol" as Lesson 4
- Promoted starting binders immediately in emergency situations
- This is the #1 mistake causing severe Herxheimer reactions

**Solution Implemented:**
- Changed Lesson 4 to "Understanding Binders (Don't Start Yet!)"
- Added extensive warnings about retoxification dangers
- Emphasized 2-4 week drainage preparation requirement
- Included real stories of people who got severely sick from early binder use

### Module Architecture Change
**Previous Structure:**
- Single large MDX file per module (500-700 lines)
- All lessons combined in one file
- Difficult to maintain and scale

**New Two-Tier Structure:**
- Main module file: Overview only (200-250 lines)
- Separate lesson files: Detailed content (250-350 lines each)
- Pattern: `/content/modules/[module].mdx` + `/content/lessons/[module]/[lesson].mdx`

### Files Created (11 New Lesson Files)

- Reduced from 680 lines to 200 line overview
- Moved detailed content to 6 separate lesson files
- Added comprehensive lab recommendations
- Included practitioner codes for direct ordering
- Added insurance coverage tips with CPT codes

### Lesson Frontmatter Standard
Established consistent frontmatter for all lessons:
```yaml
title: "Lesson Title"
description: "Brief description"
moduleSlug: "module-slug"
lessonNumber: 1-6
duration: "5-15 minutes"
type: "reading|exercise|resource"

## 2025-08-11 - Critical Phase 1 Infrastructure Complete (Days 10-12, 18-19)

### Summary
Completed critical Phase 1 infrastructure including dashboard widgets, module gating logic, and the essential Drainage Readiness Score tool. This tool is the primary safety gate preventing users from starting binders before their drainage pathways are ready, which could cause severe detox reactions. All components align with Kajsa's protocol requiring 80% drainage readiness for 7 consecutive days before binder access.

### Dashboard Widgets Created (Day 10)
- `components/dashboard/retest-countdown.tsx` - VCS and mycotoxin testing schedule tracker
- `components/dashboard/daily-tip.tsx` - Rotating daily tips with actionable mold recovery advice
- `components/dashboard/community-highlight.tsx` - Success stories and community engagement
- Updated `app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx` - Integrated all new widgets in responsive grid

### Module Infrastructure (Day 11-12)
- `lib/modules/prerequisite-checker.ts` - Enforces module dependencies and safety requirements
- `lib/modules/gating-logic.ts` - Comprehensive gating system with critical safety gates
  - Implements 80% drainage for 7 days requirement before binders
  - Tracks completion percentages for module unlocking
  - Provides user-friendly unlock instructions

### Drainage Readiness Score Tool (Day 18-19) - CRITICAL SAFETY FEATURE
- `app/(app)/tools/drainage-readiness/page.tsx` - Main tool page with safety warnings
- `components/tools/drainage/daily-form.tsx` - 10-metric assessment form with tooltips
- `components/tools/drainage/trend-chart.tsx` - Visual progress tracking with target lines
- `components/tools/drainage/suggestions.tsx` - Personalized improvement recommendations
- `lib/calculations/drainage-score.ts` - Weighted scoring algorithm (bowels 20%, liver 15%, hydration 12%)
- `lib/calculations/rolling-average.ts` - 7-day rolling average calculations
- `app/api/tools/drainage/route.ts` - Database persistence and badge awarding

### Key Safety Features Implemented
- **Hard Gate on Binders**: Module 04 (Binders) locked until 80% drainage for 7 days
- **Visual Safety Alerts**: Red warnings when drainage is insufficient
- **Progress Tracking**: Clear countdown showing days until binder unlock
- **Weighted Scoring**: Critical pathways (bowels, liver, hydration) have higher weights
- **Badge System**: Awards "drainage-unlocked" badge when ready for binders
- **Database Integration**: Saves to Readiness table for module gating checks

### Technical Highlights
- All components use TypeScript with proper interfaces
- Chart visualizations with Recharts library
- LocalStorage + database persistence for offline capability
- Responsive design works on all device sizes
- Real-time score calculation and trend analysis

### Phase 1 Progress Update
- **Day 10**: ✅ All dashboard widgets complete (9/9 tasks)
- **Day 11-12**: ✅ Module infrastructure complete (4/4 tasks)
- **Day 18-19**: ✅ Drainage Readiness tool complete (8/8 tasks)
- **Critical Path Clear**: Users can now safely progress through detox protocol

### Safety Impact
This update ensures users cannot access potentially harmful binder protocols without proper preparation. The drainage tool provides clear guidance on improving each pathway, tracks progress over time, and only unlocks advanced protocols when it's safe to proceed. This aligns perfectly with Kajsa's experience that rushing into binders without drainage preparation causes severe detox reactions.

## Maintenance Guidelines

### When to Update
- After every 5-10 file modifications
- At the end of each work session
- Before switching to a different feature
- After major decisions or pivots
- When encountering and solving significant problems

### What to Include
- File changes with purpose
- Architectural decisions
- Problem-solution pairs
- Dependencies added/removed
- Configuration changes
- API endpoint changes
- Database schema updates
- External service integrations

### How to Update
1. Add new entry at the top (reverse chronological)
2. Use consistent date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
3. Be concise but complete
4. Include context for future readers
5. Reference relevant documentation
6. Note any blockers or concerns

### Why This Matters
- AI assistants lose context between sessions
- Team members need to understand recent changes
- Helps identify patterns and recurring issues
- Documents the evolution of decisions
- Provides audit trail for debugging
- Enables efficient handoffs between developers
