## Food as Medicine or Poison

What you eat during mold recovery can either accelerate healing or sabotage your progress. Many foods contain mold or feed fungal growth in your body, while others support detoxification and reduce inflammation.

> **Critical Fact:** Up to 25% of the world's food crops are contaminated with mycotoxins. During recovery, you must be extremely selective.
