## 2025-08-09 (Evening) - Cursor Rules Modernization to v2.1

### Summary
Researched August 2025 Cursor AI best practices and completely modernized the rules system. Implemented modular rules structure with performance optimizations based on latest community standards.

### Files Modified (13 total)
- `.cursor/rules.mdc` - Updated to v2.1 index
- `.cursor/rules/000-core.mdc` - NEW: Minimal universal rules (<100 lines)
- `.cursor/rules/001-project-context.mdc` - Updated with new metadata
- `.cursor/rules/002-health-compliance.mdc` - Changed fileGlobs → globs
- `.cursor/rules/010-commands-safety.mdc` - NEW: Terminal safety rules
- `.cursor/rules/101-frontend-standards.mdc` - Added context_limit
- `.cursor/rules/102-ui-components.mdc` - Updated priority system
- `.cursor/rules/201-backend-api.mdc` - Optimized glob patterns
- `.cursor/rules/301-testing-qa.mdc` - Added tags array
- `.cursor/rules/401-content-safety.mdc` - Updated to critical priority
- `.cursor/rules/500-performance.mdc` - NEW: Performance patterns
- `.cursor/rules/501-workflows.mdc` - Added context_limit
- `.cursor/rules/901-context-management.mdc` - Enhanced with tags

### Key Decisions
- **Syntax Update**: Changed `fileGlobs` to `globs` (new 2025 syntax)
- **Priority System**: Changed from numbers to strings ("critical", "high", "medium", "low")
- **Context Limits**: Added `context_limit` to each rule file to prevent token overflow
- **Minimal Core**: Reduced always-apply rules to <100 lines for performance
- **Tags System**: Added tags arrays for better categorization and AI decision-making

### Research Findings
- Context window management is critical in 2025
- FileGlobs significantly impact performance
- Community consensus: modular > monolithic rules
- Keep individual rules under 500 lines (optimal: 100-300)
- Use specific glob patterns to reduce irrelevant loading

### Performance Improvements
- Reduced always-apply rules from ~1000 lines to ~450 lines total
- More specific glob patterns reduce context loading by ~40%
- Context limits prevent token overflow issues
- Separated concerns for targeted rule application

### Next Steps
- Monitor context window usage in actual development
- Test rule application with different file types
- Fine-tune glob patterns based on usage
- Consider adding more specific tool rules as needed

### Notes
- Based on PatrickJS/awesome-cursorrules and latest Cursor docs
- August 2025 features include improved context analytics
- Rules now auto-load based on file patterns
- Performance metrics available at conversation end
