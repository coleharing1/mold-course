# 2) Target Use Cases & Scenarios

**Top reasons people join (tie to real-life moments)**

* Chronic fatigue & brain fog → *“I used to be sharp; now I lose words mid‑sentence.”*&#x20;
* Mystery symptoms doctors can’t solve → *“All my labs are ‘normal’ but I feel awful.”*
* Skin issues, rashes, sensitivities → *“Hives after showers; worse in humid weather.”*&#x20;
* Sinus & respiratory flares → *“My chest tightens at home, eases on vacation.”*
* Post‑flood/move/apartment issues → *“New place smells musty; kids keep getting sick.”*

# 9) Market Positioning & Sophistication Stages

**Examples tailored to mold detox**

* **Stage 1 – Claim:** “Heal from mold exposure.”
* **Stage 2 – Exaggerated Claim:** “Eliminate every mold symptom in 7 days.”
* **Stage 3 – New Mechanism:** “Finally detox mold without binders, fasting, or extreme protocols—our 4‑Phase Self‑Guided Method.”
* **Stage 4 – Better Mechanism:** “Most programs push detox; we start by proving/removing exposure and opening drainage—then we add binders/antifungals.” (Aligns with CDC/EPA emphasis on fixing moisture/mold and practical screening like VCS.) ([US EPA][22], [Surviving Mold][14])
* **Stage 5 – Identity/Lifestyle:** “For everyday people who want to feel like themselves again—without spending \$10,000 on specialists.”

**Recommendation:** Position at **Stage 4**.

* **Why:** Consumer courses often emphasize protocols and supplements (Stage 3 style). By leading with *exposure identification + moisture control + simple screening (VCS)* you’re both safer and more credible—and you differentiate from detox‑first course competitors. EPA/CDC materials consistently stress moisture control & targeted cleanup over broad “toxin detox” claims; VCS is an accepted, low‑cost screening tool. ([US EPA][22], [Surviving Mold][14])
* **Demand signals:** FB groups and Reddit threads are full of *overwhelm* and *sequence confusion* (exposure vs detox). Your “better mechanism” messaging resolves this and mirrors community needs. ([Facebook][9], [Reddit][17])
* **Search/interest context:** Google Trends provides relative interest (not absolute search volume) and is commonly used to size curiosity waves for topics like “mold detox”—use it to time campaigns around seasonality (see §11). ([Google News Initiative][23])

* Side‑by‑side symptom tracker (Week 0 vs Week 4).
* Creator authority shot: “This nearly ruined my life. Here’s the plan I wish I had.”
* Screenshots of the **Binder Planner** and **Drainage Readiness** badge; small, clean UI.

**Patterns to emulate/avoid**

* Emulate: step‑by‑step tiles, short captions, human hands, air humidity gauges, hygrometers, HEPA filters in context.
* Avoid: sterile stock labs, fear‑bait black‑mold closeups, heavy medical imagery, supplement walls.

* *Safe Pantry Protocol* mini‑course (\$49)
* *7‑Day Detox Planner* with calendar files (\$29)

**Recurring revenue**

* \$19/mo recipes + food rotation group (low‑mold meal plans)
* Monthly audio check‑in calls (Q\&A; replays 48 hrs)

**High‑ticket ascension**

* \$2,000–\$3,000 8‑week guided cohort (limited seats), bringing in guest experts (building scientist + clinician) for office‑hours—not medical advice.

**Affiliate/JV ideas**

* Test kits (ERMI providers), HEPA purifiers, hygrometers/humidifiers; disclose and remain brand‑neutral.

## Copy & compliance guardrails you can paste into the page

* **Plain disclaimer block** (above the fold on checkout): educational only; consult a qualified clinician; align with your current PDF wording.&#x20;
* **Balanced testing note**: “Some authorities discourage biologic urine mycotoxin testing for diagnosis; we present pros/cons so you can decide with your clinician.” ([CDC][18], [Naval Medical Center][19])
* **Cleanup fundamentals**: Emphasize moisture control, humidity <60%, and safe cleanup steps per EPA; avoid bleach‑as‑default messaging. ([US EPA][31])

---

## What to implement next (high‑impact CRO to‑dos)

* **Above‑the‑fold headline** with Stage‑4 mechanism + \$15 VCS hook + 3 proof icons (EPA humidity, VCS price, cohort size cap). ([US EPA][31], [Surviving Mold][14])
* **“Start Here” tool embed** (mini exposure audit + VCS explainer) → captures email to reveal personalized plan.
* **Sticky “See Your Plan” CTA** that jumps to onboarding wizard (collects living situation, symptoms, budget).
* **FAQ accordion** that tackles the top 15 questions with links to EPA/CDC and your disclaimer. ([US EPA][22])
* **Proof bar** with rotating micro‑wins (“finished Quick‑Start,” “scheduled VCS,” “7‑day drainage streak”).
* **Price justifier** section: list the costs people fear (remediation quotes, \$300–\$600 lab panels) next to your low‑cost first steps (VCS, humidity, checklists). ([Reddit][20])

If you want, I can turn this into a **wireframed enrollment page outline** (section‑by‑section copy prompts + CTA labels) and a **lead‑gen quiz flow** you can paste into Cursor, along with the first batch of email subject lines and ad hooks.
