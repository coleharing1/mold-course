- Functional medicine certification
- Environmental medicine training

## Safety Considerations

<CriticalSafety>
Never attempt these protocols without proper medical supervision. Many require:
- Prescription medications
- IV access and sterile technique
- Specialized equipment
- Emergency protocols
- Regular lab monitoring
</CriticalSafety>

### Red Flags - Stop Everything

- Severe allergic reactions
- Chest pain or arrhythmias
- Severe headaches with vision changes
- Significant liver enzyme elevation
- Kidney function decline
- Severe psychiatric symptoms

## Module Summary

Advanced protocols offer powerful tools for complex mold illness cases, but require:

1. **Medical supervision** - All protocols need practitioner oversight
2. **Careful timing** - Build on stable foundation
3. **Monitoring** - Regular labs and symptom tracking
4. **Patience** - Advanced protocols take time
5. **Investment** - Significant time and financial commitment

Remember: These are tools for specific situations, not necessary for everyone. Many patients recover fully with standard protocols.

## Action Steps

1. **Assess your current status** - Are standard protocols insufficient?
2. **Find qualified practitioners** - Interview multiple providers
3. **Review finances** - Many advanced therapies aren't covered by insurance
4. **Create support system** - These protocols are intensive
5. **Track meticulously** - Document all responses

## Next Module
