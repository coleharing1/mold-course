# Quick Environmental Assessment
*5-minute evaluation to identify all mold sources*

## The 5-Minute Home Walkthrough

You need to quickly assess every space where you spend time. This rapid evaluation helps identify immediate dangers and guides your next steps.

### Visual Signs Checklist

**Look for these red flags:**

☑️ **Discoloration:**
- Black, green, or white spots on walls/ceilings
- Water stains (brown/yellow rings)
- Bubbling or peeling paint
- Warped walls or floors
- Discolored grout or caulking

☑️ **Moisture indicators:**
- Condensation on windows
- Damp spots on walls/floors
- Wet or soft drywall
- Rusty pipes or fixtures
- Standing water anywhere

☑️ **Structural changes:**
- Warped baseboards
- Buckling floors
- Separated caulking
- Cracked foundation
- Sagging ceilings

### Smell Test

**Trust your nose:**
- **Musty/earthy odor** = Active mold growth
- **"Old building" smell** = Chronic moisture
- **Sweet/fermenting smell** = Advanced mold
- **Stronger when AC/heat runs** = HVAC contamination

**Important:** Some dangerous molds have no odor. Absence of smell doesn't mean absence of mold.

### Quick Moisture Check

**Without equipment:**
- Touch walls - do they feel cool/damp?
- Check windows for condensation
- Look for water marks on ceilings
- Feel carpets for dampness
- Note if air feels humid/heavy

**With basic tools ($30 moisture meter):**
- Normal: 5-12% moisture content
- Concerning: 15-17%
- Critical: 20%+ (mold guaranteed)

## Check Your Car (Often Overlooked!)

Cars are enclosed spaces where you spend significant time. Mold here can maintain your symptoms even after leaving a moldy home.

### AC System Check

**Turn on AC and check for:**
- Musty smell immediately
- Smell gets stronger over time
- Visible debris from vents
- Weak airflow (clogged filter)
- Windows fogging excessively

**Quick cabin air filter check:**
1. Locate filter (usually behind glove box)
2. Remove and inspect
3. Look for black/green growth
4. Check for excessive dirt/debris
5. Replace if any doubt ($15-30)

### Physical Inspection

**Check these areas:**

**Under floor mats:**
- Lift all mats completely
- Check for moisture/stains
- Feel carpet underneath
- Look for rust on floor

**Trunk inspection:**
- Check spare tire well (common water trap)
- Lift trunk liner
- Look for water stains
- Check weatherstripping

**Other areas:**
- Door panels (water can collect)
- Under seats
- Headliner (roof fabric)
- Sunroof drains
