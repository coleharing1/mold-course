Step 1: Identify Your Exposure
☑ Check your home, office, car, and frequent environments for
mold sources.
☑ If you suspect exposure, test your environment and body for
mold (ERMI, urine mycotoxin test).
Step 2: Reduce Further Exposure
☑ If possible, leave the moldy environment or remediate properly.
☑ Use air purifiers, HEPA filters, and moisture control to minimize
exposure.
Step 3: Prepare Your Body for Detox
☑ Support drainage pathways (bowel movements, liver, lymphatic
system, kidneys).
☑ Hydrate with electrolytes, eat a detox-supporting diet, and start
sweating regularly.
Step 4: Start Detoxing Safely
☑ Introduce binders slowly (Cholestyramine, activated charcoal,
etc.).
☑ Start antifungals only after drainage pathways are open.
☑ Monitor symptoms and adjust your detox pace accordingly.
Step 5: Maintain Long-Term Prevention
☑ Regularly test your environment and body to avoid re-exposure.
☑ Continue sauna therapy, clean diet, and home air filtration.
☑ Track progress and retest mycotoxin levels after 3-6 months.Quick-Start Guide

Introduction
This protocol is for anyone who has been exposed to mold, lived in
mold, tested positive for mycotoxins, and now feels completely
overwhelmed by the flood of conflicting advice from doctors,
naturopaths, and the internet.
I’ve been there. I unknowingly spent a significant amount of my time
in a house filled with mold. And before that, I lived in several
apartments, that I found out later, were also likely mold-infested.  
Looking back, I suspect I had been exposed for years before my
symptoms became impossible to ignore.
It started slowly. I felt more tired than usual. Then came the brain
fog, vertigo, and skin rashes. My anxiety skyrocketed, I gained
weight, I had memory lapse, I was exhausted no matter how much I
slept. My hormones were completely out of balance. At first, I
thought it was maybe just stress, diet, or something I could fix with
lifestyle changes. But nothing worked. Doctors had no real
answers, and I was left searching for solutions on my own.
That’s when I started digging deeper. I took a mycotoxin test, which
confirmed what I suspected—my body was loaded with mold toxins.
Through trial and error, I discovered what actually works. This guide
cuts through the confusion and provides a straightforward,
practical approach to mold detox.

You notice symptoms worsen in
certain locations (at home but
improve when traveling).How to Suspect You’ve Been Exposed
to M old
YOU MAY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO MOLD IF:
You recently spent time in a water-
damaged building (home, office, school,
hotel).
You smell a musty, earthy odor
in your environment.
You see visible mold on walls,
ceilings, vents, or furniture.You have past water damage (leaky pipes,
roof leaks, past flooding).
Your HVAC system or air vents smell
musty or release dust that worsens
symptoms.
Other people in the same
environment also have similar
symptoms.
Your symptoms worsen in
humid conditions or after a
rainstorm.
MOLD IN WATER-DAMAGED BUILDINGS
Nearly 47% of U.S. homes show signs of dampness or mold,
with water damage being a primary contributor.
Water damage from exterior sources (roof leaks, flooding)
affects 10% of homes, interior sources (plumbing leaks, poor
ventilation) impacts 8%.
Mold can start growing within 24–48 hours after water
exposure and spread rapidly if moisture isn’t controlled.
Black Mold (Stachybotrys chartarum) – Thrives on water-
damaged materials like drywall and wood.
Aspergillus – Common on dust, HVAC systems, and building
materials.
Alternaria & Penicillium – Frequently found in damp areas like
basements, carpets, and insulation.

--- Page 8 ---
Moldy Foods 
Mold can grow on many foods, often without visible signs. Consuming moldy foods or inhaling
mold spores from spoiled items can cause digestive issues, allergic reactions, and illness from
mycotoxins (toxins produced by mold).
Fresh Foods
Fruits & Vegetables – Berries (strawberries, raspberries, blueberries), grapes, tomatoes,
avocados, peaches, apples, and leafy greens.
Nuts & Seeds – Peanuts, cashews, walnuts, pistachios, and sunflower seeds.
Grains – Corn, wheat, oats, and rice can develop mold, especially if improperly stored.
Coffee Beans – Cheap, low-quality coffee often contains mold or mycotoxins.
Dairy & Fermented Foods
Cheese – Soft cheeses like brie, blue cheese, ricotta, and cream cheese are highly
susceptible.
Milk & Yogurt – Spoiled dairy products may contain harmful mold.
Fermented Foods – Kombucha, sauerkraut, and kimchi can sometimes harbor mold if not
properly prepared.
Baked Goods & Processed Foods
Bread & Pastries – Mold grows quickly on moist baked goods, especially in humid conditions.
Dried Fruits – Raisins, dates, figs, and prunes can carry mold spores if improperly stored.
Chocolate – Low-quality chocolate may contain mold from contaminated cacao beans.
Alcohol & Beverages
Wine & Beer – Can contain mold from fermented grapes or grains.
Fruit Juices – Unpasteurized juices can grow mold if not stored properly.
How to Reduce Mold Exposure from Food
Store dry goods in airtight containers to prevent moisture buildup.
Buy fresh, high-quality foods and avoid heavily processed items.
Check for signs of spoilage (fuzziness, sour smell, sliminess).
Avoid eating partially moldy foods, as mold can spread deeper than visible areas.Most Common Sources
of Mold Exposure: 
Place Common Sources
Home (most likely
culprit)Mold thrives in HVAC systems, bathrooms (showers, sinks), kitchens (under
sinks, behind appliances), basements (poor ventilation, foundation leaks),
attics (roof leaks, poor airflow), windows (condensation), and on porous
materials like carpets and furniture.
Workplace/Public Office buildings, schools, gyms, locker rooms, hotels, and rental properties
often have hidden mold due to old buildings, poor maintenance, and water
damage from leaks or flooding. HVAC systems can spread spores.
Car Mold can grow in air conditioning vents, wet carpets, and trunk storage areas
due to spills, humidity, or leaks. A musty smell often indicates contamination.
Outdoor
EnvironmentsHigh-risk areas include damp/flooded zones, gardens with decaying leaves,
compost piles, and construction sites with dust and moisture buildup.

IDENTIFY WHERE YOU WERE
EXPOSED TO MOLD
CHECK ALL FREQUENT
ENVIRONMENTSAction Plan
STEP 1: 
The first step in addressing mold-related health issues is identifying where you
were exposed. Pinpointing the source is critical because mold is difficult and
expensive to remediate, even with professional help. The best course of action is to
remove yourself from the environment whenever possible.
I understand that moving may not be an option for everyone, but minimizing your
time in a mold-infested space is crucial. Do whatever you can to reduce exposure
until you can leave permanently.
Why Identifying Mold Exposure is Important
 Living or working in a moldy environment can prevent healing, even if you're
following detox protocols.
Home – Where you sleep and live daily.
Workplace – Does your health improve on weekends or
vacations? If so, your office may be a problem
Other Regular Spaces – Gym, library, car, or anywhere you frequent.

TYPES OF MOLD TESTING
Environmental Testing 
If you suspect mold in your surroundings, testing can confirm its presence and severity.
One of the most effective ways to test for mold in your home is by using an ERMI (Environmental
Relative Moldiness Index) or HERTSMI-2 test. These tests provide a clear picture of mold
contamination levels and deliver results quickly (within 2-3 days with expedited processing).
Recommended Mold Test Thresholds: 
ERMI Score: Less than 2
HERTSMI-2 Score: Less than 10
1. DIY Mold Test Kits
 Available online and in hardware stores, these kits allow you to collect samples yourself:
Air Sampling Kits – Capture airborne mold spores for lab analysis.
Surface Swab Tests – Collect samples from suspect areas (walls, vents, furniture).
Petri Dish Settling Tests – Detect mold spores that settle over time.
📝 Note: DIY tests can confirm mold presence but don’t identify specific mold species or toxicity
levels.
2. Professional Mold Inspection
 A mold inspector uses advanced tools to detect mold, including:
Air Quality Tests – Measure airborne spore levels.
Infrared Cameras – Detect hidden moisture sources.
Moisture Meters – Identify damp areas prone to mold growth.
Hiring a professional is recommended if you suspect hidden mold, black mold, or widespread
contamination. 👉  Recommended Resource: Yes We Inspect
Step 2: Test for Mold
Once you've identified potential mold exposure sources, the next step is to test for
mold in your environment and body. Proper testing helps determine whether mold is
affecting your health and where it's coming from.

Next Steps: Interpreting Your Results & Taking Action
➡ If Home Mold Testing is Positive: Address the source of mold through remediation or relocating.
➡ If Medical Tests Show Mycotoxin Levels: Begin detox protocols and treatment (covered in Step 3)*I recommend Urine Mycotoxin Testing

--- Page 13 ---
Step 3: Identify Which Myc0toxins Are
Present
Detoxing from mold exposure is a multi-step process that involves identifying the toxins in your
body, using the right treatments, and supporting your system to remove them effectively. Below
is a structured approach I used to detox safely and efficiently.
N E X T review your urine mycotoxin panel test results
They'll show you the values present. For example, if you used Mosaic Diagnostics it will provide
you a value range like this one:WHAT IS A MYCOTOXIN
A toxic chemical produced by certain types
of mold (fungi). These toxins can enter the
body through inhalation, skin contact, or
contaminated food and water. While not all
mold is harmful, some molds release
mycotoxins, which can accumulate in the
body over time and cause serious health
issues, including brain fog, fatigue, digestive
problems, and immune dysfunction.Before starting detox protocols, you need to know which mycotoxins are in your system. Your
results from the Mycotoxin Panel will identify which are present and determine how to treat and
remove them.
HOW TO REMOVE MYCOTOXINS
Since mycotoxins are stored in fat cells, the
liver, and the brain, detoxing requires a
strategic approach.
see the chart below for more on the proper
removal agents
Once you have your results, refer to the Mycotoxin Detox Guide on the next page 👇  
to match your specific toxins with the best detox strategies.Aflatoxin present

Step 3: Identify Which Myc0toxins Are
Present continued...
The chart below shows which binders work best for removing specific mycotoxins
found in your urine test. This is important because using the right binder ensures an
effective detox. 
 The Mycotoxin Detox Guide
Research-Backed Effective Binder Agents by Mycotoxin
 ✅ = Effective for binding the specific mycotoxin.
WHAT IS A BINDER
A binder is a substance that binds to toxins in the
digestive tract (such as mold mycotoxins, heavy
metals, pesticides, and environmental pollutants)
and helps remove them from the body through
stool. Binders are essential in mold detox because
they prevent toxins from being reabsorbed into the
bloodstream, allowing the body to safely eliminate
them. HOW BINDERS WORK
Absorb and trap toxins in the gut. 1.
Prevent reabsorption of mycotoxins and
other harmful substances.2.
Facilitate elimination through the intestines
via bowel movements. 3.
WHEN & HOW TO TAKE BINDERS
Take on an empty stomach (30–60 minutes
before meals or 2+ hours after eating).
Drink plenty of water to prevent constipation.
Separate from medications & supplements by at
least 2 hours.
Rotate different binders for best detox results.WHY BINDERS ARE CRITICAL
If you start detoxing without binders, the toxins
released from fat cells can recirculate in your
body, leading to worsening symptoms. Binders
trap the toxins and remove them safely,
reducing detox side effects and speeding up
recovery. 

--- Page 15 ---
Step 4: Open Drainage Pathways
Before you begin actively detoxing mold from your body, it’s critical to first open your drainage
pathways—the body’s natural detoxification routes. If these pathways are sluggish or blocked,
releasing mold toxins too quickly can cause severe detox reactions (also known as Herxheimer
reactions), making symptoms worse instead of better.Open Detox Pathways Before Starting Detox
WHY DRAINAGE PATHWAYS MATTER
Mold toxins are stored in fat cells and deep tissues. As you
introduce binders, antifungals, and detox supplements,
these toxins are released into circulation. Without proper
drainage, they can reabsorb into your body instead of
being eliminated, leading to increased inflammation,
fatigue, brain fog, and other symptoms.
To avoid this, you need to ensure all drainage pathways
are open and functioning optimally before starting detox
protocols.WHEN TO OPEN DRAINAGE PATHWAYS 
You should focus on drainage support for
at least 2-4 weeks before starting mold
detox (prescriptions, binders, or
antifungals).
Here’s what to do:
1. Support Bowel Movements (Primary Exit Route)
💩 Ensure 1-3 bowel movements per day – if you are constipated, mold toxins will recirculate in your
system.
Drink half your body weight in ounces of filtered water daily
Increase fiber intake (inulin, organic vegetables, chia/flax seeds if tolerated)
Take magnesium citrate or Vitamin C powder for gentle relief
Consider digestive bitters or a castor oil pack over the liver
CellCore has a Jump Start Kit [HERE] to gently ease into your mold detox, I did not use this because
I knew my drainage pathways were already open but some may need to start here. 
‼ If you are not having daily bowel movements, do NOT start binders yet—fix constipation first!
2. Optimize Liver & Gallbladder Function (Toxin Processing)
The liver filters toxins from the blood and packages them for elimination through bile. If bile flow is
sluggish, detox can feel unbearable.
Increase bile flow with bitter foods (dandelion greens, artichokes, arugula)
Take ox bile, taurine, or milk thistle to support the liver detox
Use a castor oil pack over the liver for 20-30 minutes daily
Avoid alcohol, seed oils, and processed foods
3. Stimulate the Lymphatic System (Waste Transport System)
The lymphatic system transports toxins from tissues to drainage organs, but unlike blood circulation,
it doesn’t have a pump—it relies on movement.
Do gentle movement or rebounding (light bouncing on a trampoline)
Try dry brushing (2-3 minutes before showering) [HERE]
Get a lymphatic drainage massage or use a vibration plate
‼ If your lymph system is stagnant, toxins can get “stuck” and cause swelling, fatigue, or flu-like
symptoms.

--- Page 16 ---
4. Support Kidneys (Filter & Flush Toxins)
Your kidneys filter out mold toxins through urine. If you are dehydrated, toxins won’t be excreted
properly.
Drink electrolyte-rich filtered water (add a pinch of sea salt or electrolytes)
Herbal teas like dandelion, nettle, or parsley tea help flush toxins
Avoid excessive caffeine, alcohol, and excessive protein if kidney function is sluggish
 ‼  If you’re not urinating regularly, hydration must be a priority before detoxing.
5. Sweat Out Toxins (Skin as a Detox Organ)
Your skin is an important detox organ, and sweating helps eliminate mycotoxins.
Use an infrared sauna (start with 5 min and work up to 45 min, 3-5x per week)
Exercise regularly (strength training + cardio to promote circulation)
Take detox baths with Epsom salt and baking soda
 ‼ If you don’t sweat easily, your detox pathways may be blocked—work on this before starting
binders or antifungals.
6. Once you’re sweating, hydrated, and having bowel movements once per day you’re ready to
start the next phase.Step 4: Open Drainage Pathways
Continued...

--- Page 17 ---
Step 5: Introduce Binders
Congrats! It's time to start introducing mold detox protocols in this order:
Weeks 1-4: Open Drainage Pathways (Required Before Detoxing Mold)
Ensure daily bowel movements
Support liver, kidneys, lymph, and sweating
Hydrate with minerals & electrolytes
‼  Once you have consistent drainage (pooping, sweating, peeing daily), move to binders
 
Weeks 5-8: Introduce Binders (Pull Toxins Out)
Start low and slow with binders (Cholestyramine, Cellcore protocol, Activated Charcoal,
Chlorella, Ultra Binder)
Take binders 1-2 hours away from food, supplements, and medications
Continue drainage support to avoid detox reactions
 ‼  If you tolerate binders well and symptoms don’t worsen, add in Antifungals
Weeks 9-12: Introduce Antifungals (Kill Off Fungus in the Body) 
Start prescription antifungals (Itraconazole) or natural antifungals (Neem, Biopure O3)
Support liver & detox pathways heavily during this phase
Expect die-off reactions—slow down if symptoms become too intense
Prescription Medications – The Fastest & Most
Effective Detox
From my personal experience, prescription medications were the turning point in my
recovery—they provided the fastest and most effective detox. This was when I truly started
to feel better and saw the biggest improvements. The supplements alone weren’t making
enough of a difference for me.
As someone who used to avoid Western medicine whenever possible (I can’t even
remember the last time I took a Tylenol), I was hesitant to go this route. But looking back, I
am so glad I did. Unlike everything else I had tried—where I couldn’t tell what was working—
these medications brought noticeable relief. My naturopath had told me it could take a year
to see improvement, yet within a week of starting these prescriptions, my symptoms were
dissipating. This is why I’m sharing this information—I wish I had known about these
medications sooner. If I had stuck with supplements alone, I have no idea if or when I would
have seen real progress. I am so grateful for what these medications did for me.
That said, I had to advocate for myself. I met with telehealth doctors, presented my lab
results, and specifically requested these prescriptions. I sent the telehealth doctor the
research from Dr. Shoemaker (linked below) and explained my case. Fortunately, I found a
doctor willing to prescribe cholestyramine for off-label use and itraconazole. If this is the
route you want to take, be prepared to stand your ground and advocate for your health.

Prescription Medications Needed
A. Cholestyramine (CSM) – The Primary Binder
Things to Consider Before Taking Cholestyramine (CSM) or Welchol
1. Tolerance & Side Effects
CSM may not be well tolerated due to gastrointestinal issues.
If CSM is not tolerated, Dr. Shoemaker recommends Welchol as an alternative.
Welchol has fewer side effects but only 25% of the binding capacity of CSM (may result in a longer
detox)
2. Combining CSM & Welchol for Better Tolerance
A combination may improve efficacy while minimizing side effects:
CSM → Take in the morning and at bedtime               Welchol → Take with lunch and dinner
3. Special Considerations
Chemically sensitive patients or those with food allergies → Consider Welchol instead of CSM.
Aspartame sensitivity → Avoid aspartame-containing CSM in patients w/ anxiety or depression.
Candida overgrowth or food sensitivities → Use compounded CSM, which contains only Stevia.
4. Preventing Intensification Reactions
If you have Lyme  → To prevent detox reactions, pretreat with:
Low-Amylose diet + Actos (45 mg) for 5 days before starting CSM
Alternatively, if Leptin <7, use: 2.4g EPA + 1.8g DHA (high-dose fish oil) instead of Actos
For sicker patients, titrate Welchol slowly.
5. Drug & Nutrient Interactions
CSM can reduce the efficacy of:
Coumadin (Warfarin) | Thyroid hormones | Thiazide diuretics
Solution → Administer these drugs 1 hour before or 2 hours after taking CSM.
CSM can interfere with fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K).
Solution → Dose these vitamins separately to prevent deficiencies.
6. Dosing Strategy
Titrate slowly to a full dose, if necessary to improve tolerance and reduce side effects.

Prescription Medications Needed
B. Itraconazole – The Antifungal Medication
What Mold-Related Issues Is Itraconazole Effective For?
Itraconazole is commonly prescribed for:
✔ Aspergillus-related infections – Aspergillus mold is a common environmental mold that
can cause lung and sinus issues.
✔ Systemic fungal infections – If mold toxins have weakened the immune system,
secondary fungal infections (like Candida overgrowth) can occur.
✔ Mycotoxin-associated illness – Itraconazole helps reduce fungal load in the body,
preventing further toxin production.
✔ Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS) – Often caused by mold exposure,
Itraconazole can assist in fungal detox.
✔ Mold-related skin, nail, and respiratory infections – Useful for infections caused by mold
exposure in immunocompromised individuals.
How Itraconazole Works for Mold Detox
Disrupts fungal cell membranes – Stops mold and fungi from growing in the body.
Reduces fungal colonization – Prevents mold from multiplying in the sinuses, gut, and
lungs.
Dosage & Duration
Typical dosing varies, but for mold-related illness:
💊 100–200 mg per day (divided into one or two doses)
📆 Duration: 2–4 weeks (sometimes longer for chronic cases)
Things to Consider Before Taking Itraconazole
⚠ Liver Monitoring – Itraconazole can impact liver function, so regular bloodwork is
recommended.
⚠ Absorption is better with food – Take with a meal for best results.
⚠ Not a standalone cure – It should be used alongside detox strategies (binders, drainage
support, sauna therapy).
Itraconazole is especially effective when mold has colonized the body, making it a valuable
tool for those with ongoing fungal infections due to mold exposure. However, it should be
used under medical supervision and paired with a full mold detox protocol for best results.

Alternative Options If You Can’t Get a
Prescription:
If you’re unable to get prescription medications, there are natural alternatives
that can still be effective. However for ME, these methods were not strong
enough and I saw the most improvement in my symptoms when I took the
Cellcore Supplements, Cholestyramine,  and Itraconazole together.

Step 7: Managing Detox Symptoms
(Herxheimer Reaction)
When mold toxins are released from fat cells and start circulating
in your system, you may experience temporary worsening of
symptoms (called a Herxheimer reaction).
Common Herx Symptoms:
☑ Fatigue
☑ Brain fog
☑ Joint pain
☑ Flu-like symptoms
How to Reduce Herx Reactions:
Start Slowly – Introduce binders and detox treatments
gradually. Dont go all in at once start slowly and gradually
increase as you watch your symptoms. Talk to a doctor.
Support Drainage Pathways – Keep your bowels moving,
sweat regularly, and stay hydrated.
Use Binders – Cholestyramine, bentonite clay, and activated
charcoal help absorb toxins.
Rest & Recover – Overloading detox too quickly can make
symptoms worse.

--- Page 22 ---
Sauna Therapy for Mycotoxin Detox
Sweating is a powerful way to remove stored mold
toxins. Infrared sauna therapy is especially effective.
How to Use a Sauna Safely:
Start with 5-10 minutes at low heat (110-130°F),
gradually increasing over time.
Work up to 30-45 minutes, 3-5 times per week.
Hydrate before & after with electrolytes to
prevent dehydration.
Shower immediately after to remove toxins from
your skin.
 Melatonin for Mycotoxin Detox – it’s role
in your brain 
Mold can cross the blood-brain barrier, leading to
brain fog, memory issues, and cognitive
dysfunction. The glymphatic system (the brain’s
detox system) flushes out toxins during sleep.
Why Take Melatonin?
✔ Supports glymphatic drainage to remove mold
toxins from the brain.
✔ Improves deep sleep, which is essential for detox.
✔ Recommended Dose: 1-3 mg nightly (adjust as
needed).
Strength Training for Detox
Why strength training helps with mold detox:
💪 Releases Toxins – Mold toxins accumulate in fat
cells. Strength training promotes fat burning,
releasing stored toxins for elimination.
⚡ Boosts Mitochondria – Increases energy
production and helps the body handle toxic stress.Step 7: Add in Other Detox M odalities

Weeks 1-4: Preparation & Drainage Support
Focus on Cellcore Advanced MYC Support Kit to prep detox pathways.
No binders or antifungals yet to prevent toxin buildup in the body.
Ease into sauna, strength training, grounding, and hydration support detox.
Weeks 5-8: Active Detox (Binders & Antifungals Introduced)
Cholestyramine (CSM) starts at Week 5 to bind mycotoxins in the gut.
Itraconazole begins at Week 7 to clear fungal overgrowth in the body.
Continue sauna, ozone therapy, and gut support (probiotics, diet, etc.).
First signs of improvement often appear here but detox symptoms (fatigue,
headaches) may temporarily increase.
Weeks 9-10: Continued Detox & Monitoring
Second round of Itraconazole & Cholestyramine (if tolerated well).
Most people feel significantly better by this point, but full detox isn’t complete.
Maintain sauna, strength training, hydration, and clean diet.
Months 3-6: Long-Term Recovery & Prevention
Residual mycotoxins may take months to fully clear.
Continue binders as needed for re-exposure.
Air purification, mold-free diet, and regular detox habits prevent relapse.
Healing the gut, brain, and immune system takes time, so ongoing support (probiotics,
omega-3s, vitamin D, melatonin) is recommended.Estim ated Tim eline
Total Duration: ~3 to 6 Months (Varies by Individual Response & Severity of Exposure). 
This protocol follows a structured detox approach that lasts at least 10 weeks, but full
recovery can take 3-6 months or longer depending on:
✔ Severity of mold exposure (length of time exposed, types of mycotoxins)
✔ Toxic load & individual detox capacity (some people need longer to clear toxins)
✔ Immune function & gut health before starting detox
✔ Consistency with drainage support, binders, antifungals, and lifestyle changes

--- Page 24 ---
Retesting Again After Detox
I recommend conducting a follow-up test using the VCS Test (affordable and easily
accessible)  after 3 months to assess your progress, and again after 4 to 7 months via Urine
Analysis to make so you are on the right track.
After following this protocol, I retested 7 months later using the same Mosaic Diagnostics
Mycotoxin Test, and the results were nearly mold-free. The remaining mycotoxins were
present only in low “normal rage” amounts, a dramatic improvement from my initial test,
where my levels were off the charts for:
✔ Aflatoxin
✔ Ochratoxins
✔ Citrinin
✔ Gliotoxin
This was a complete 180-degree turnaround for me. I could clearly tell the difference in the
way I felt but seeing it on the results confirmed that the detox protocol worked, and my
body was finally clearing out what had made me so sick.
 Retesting is crucial to track progress and ensure that you’re eliminating mycotoxins
effectively.Tracking Your Progress
Retest urine mycotoxin levels every 3-6 months to track improvement.
Work with a doctor to monitor liver enzymes and adjust your detox plan.
 Listen to your body – detoxing is a process; push through but don’t overdo it.

Cleaning Mold
Why Using Bleach on Mold Can Make It Worse
Bleach is often recommended for mold removal, but it’s one of the worst methods for mold
remediation. Here’s why:
❌ Ineffective on Porous Surfaces – Bleach only removes surface mold but leaves the roots
intact, especially on drywall and wood.
❌ Can Make Mold Worse – The high water content in bleach can feed mold growth, making it
return even stronger.
❌ Releases More Mold Spores – Bleach triggers mold to release spores into the air, spreading
contamination and increasing health risks.
❌ Produces Toxic Fumes – The chemicals in bleach can irritate the lungs, especially for mold-
sensitive individuals.
Best Mold Removal Alternatives
✔ Hydrogen Peroxide (3-6%) – Penetrates porous surfaces and kills mold at its roots.
✔ Undiluted Vinegar – Natural antifungal that kills mold and prevents regrowth.
✔ Concrobium or EC3 Mold Spray – Botanical, non-toxic mold cleaners that help prevent mold
regrowth.
✔ HEPA Vacuuming & Air Filtration – Helps remove airborne mold spores from your environment.

Frequently Asked Questions
1. How do I know if my symptoms are from mold exposure?
Symptoms often worsen in suspected moldy environments and improve when leaving. Test options: ERMI, urine
mycotoxin test.
2. Who is Dr. Ritchie Shoemaker, and how did he develop his mold protocol?
Dr. Shoemaker identified Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS) in 1997 after patients became sick from
toxic algae. He developed a step-by-step detox protocol after discovering how mycotoxins trigger chronic immune
reactions.
3. What is cholestyramine, and how does it work?
A binder that removes mycotoxins via bile, preventing reabsorption. Standard dose: 4g, 4x daily before meals. Side
effects: Constipation, bloating, vitamin depletion.
4. What does a failed Visual Contrast Screening (VCS) mean?
A failed VCS test s u g g e s t s biotoxin illness The test measures contrast sensitivity, which is often impaired in those
exposed to mold and other biotoxins.Key areas to check: Columns C & D show neurological deficits, while row E
failing before row D can indicate hyperacute exposure. If row E & D fail + MMP-9 is elevated, this suggests
intensification (worsening inflammatory response).
VCS is not a standalone diagnosis but a valuable screening tool to determine if mold toxicity is affecting brain
function.
5. How long do you need to take cholestyramine in the Shoemaker Protocol?
Minimum: 30 days, then reassess. Typical: 3-6 months. Severe cases: 6-12+ months. CSM is discontinued once
symptoms improve and labs normalize. Retesting urine mycotoxin levels helps track progress.
6. How should I titrate up my cholestyramine dose?
Start slowly to avoid detox reactions: Week 1: ¼ scoop (or serving) daily. Week 2: ½ scoop 1-2x daily. Week 3+:
Full dose (4x daily). Stay hydrated and supplement vitamins A, D, E, K.
7. What is Sporanox (Itraconazole), and when is it needed?
An antifungal used for lung, sinus, and gut mold infections. Dose: 100mg 2x daily for 2-4 weeks. Side effects: Liver
toxicity, nausea, dizziness.
8. Can I start Sporanox sooner if I tolerate cholestyramine well?
Yes. If you feel good after Week 1 of CSM, you can begin Sporanox sooner. Monitor for detox reactions.
9. How should I titrate up my Sporanox dose?
Week 1: 100mg once daily. Week 2: Increase to 100mg twice daily. Monitor liver enzymes every 2-4 weeks.
10. What is the Ritchie Shoemaker Protocol?
A step-by-step detox plan: 
1) Remove exposure, 2) Use binders (CSM/Welchol), 3) Reduce inflammation, 4) Treat infections (antifungals if
needed).
11. How can I prevent re-exposure to mold?
Test your home (ERMI/HERTSMI-2), HEPA filters & dehumidifiers, avoid moldy foods (grains, peanuts, coffee),
clean HVAC.
12. What are the most mold-prone cities in the U.S.?
High-risk cities: New Orleans, Houston, Tampa, Miami, San Antonio.
13. What percentage of buildings have mold?
47% of U.S. homes and 85% of commercial buildings have mold or water damage. Mold can grow within 24-48
hoursof moisture exposure.
14. How do I manage detox reactions (Herxheimer)?
Stay hydrated, sweat (sauna, exercise), and use binders (charcoal, CSM).
15. Can mold cause long-term neurological issues?
Yes, mold toxins cause brain inflammation, anxiety, memory loss, depression, and fatigue. Solutions: Melatonin,
omega-3s, sauna.
16. How does sauna therapy help with mold detox?
Sweats out mycotoxins stored in fat. Start at 110-130°F for 10 min, work up to 30-45 min, 3-5x per week. Hydrate
before & after.
17. Can mold exposure trigger autoimmune diseases?
Some research suggest this. Mold overactivates the immune system, worsening conditions like Hashimoto’s, lupus,
rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic fatigue.
18. How does mold impact hormones?
Mold disrupts thyroid function, cortisol, testosterone, and estrogen. This can cause fatigue, weight gain, insomnia.
19. How do I know if I need antifungals like Sporanox?
Needed if you have persistent sinus/lung infections, bloating, worsened symptoms in humidity or after eating
carbs,or positive Aspergillus/mold tests.
20. Do I need prescriptions or can I go the holistic route?
You should do what you feel most comfortable with. However in my personal experience I didn't feel better until I
took CSM and sporonox.
