# Health & Medical Compliance Rules

## Content Guidelines
- ALWAYS include medical disclaimers on health-related content
- NEVER make specific medical claims or diagnoses
- Use "may help" instead of "will cure"
- Reference peer-reviewed sources when possible
- Mark all content with evidence levels (Solid/Emerging/Controversial)

## Safety Protocols
- Flag content needing medical review with safety-flag class
- Include contraindications for all supplements
- Warn about potential medication interactions
- Emphasize "consult your healthcare provider" prominently
- Gate sensitive content behind readiness checks

## Module Gating Rules
- ENFORCE drainage readiness before binder modules
- Require symptom tracking for 7 days before unlocking advanced protocols
- Lock antifungal content until binders phase complete
- Display clear prerequisites on locked modules
- Show readiness scores and explain why content is gated

## Vulnerable Populations
- Pregnant/nursing warnings on all protocols
- Age-specific considerations (children, elderly)
- Immune-compromised precautions highlighted
- Severity-based modifications offered
- Emergency symptoms list with "seek immediate care" warnings

## Data Privacy
- No storage of medical diagnoses
- Anonymize all user health data
- Comply with HIPAA-adjacent practices
- Secure symptom tracking with encryption
- Allow data export and deletion

## Required Disclaimers
```tsx
// Example medical disclaimer component
<div className="medical-disclaimer">
  <h4 className="medical-disclaimer-title">
    ⚠️ Medical Disclaimer
  </h4>
  <p className="medical-disclaimer-text">
    This content is for educational purposes only and not medical advice.
    Always consult with a qualified healthcare provider before starting any protocol.
  </p>
</div>
```
