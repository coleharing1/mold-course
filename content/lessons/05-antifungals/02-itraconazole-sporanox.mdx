# Itraconazole (Sporanox) Protocol
*The prescription antifungal that changed everything*

<EvidenceBadge level="emerging" />

## Understanding Itraconazole

### What is Sporanox?

**Itraconazole facts:**
- Generic name: Itraconazole
- Brand names: Sporanox, Onmel
- Class: Triazole antifungal
- Mechanism: Inhibits fungal cell membrane synthesis
- Particularly effective against: Aspergillus, Candida, Penicillium

**Why it's preferred for mold:**
- Broad spectrum against common molds
- Good tissue penetration
- Reaches sinuses effectively
- Long half-life (once/twice daily dosing)
- Extensive clinical experience

<SafetyFlag 
  type="critical"
  message="Itraconazole requires prescription, liver monitoring, and careful drug interaction screening. Never self-medicate or adjust doses without medical supervision."
/>

## Getting Your Prescription

### Telehealth Options

<DoThisNow 
  title="Self-Advocacy Script"
  action="Tell your doctor: 'I have confirmed fungal colonization based on [test results]. I've been on binders for [duration] with limited improvement. I'd like to try itraconazole following the mold illness protocol with appropriate liver monitoring. I understand the risks and will comply with all monitoring requirements.'"
  urgency="high"
/>

**Finding prescribers:**
1. **Mold-literate doctors**
   - Check ISEAI.org directory
   - SurvivingMold practitioners
   - Often familiar with protocol

2. **Infectious disease specialists**
   - Understand antifungals well
   - May need education on mold illness
   - Bring research papers

3. **Telehealth platforms**
   - Many mold doctors offer virtual visits
   - Can prescribe across state lines (varies)
   - Often more affordable

### What You Need for Appointment

**Bring documentation:**
- Positive fungal cultures or tests
- Failed treatment history
- Current medication list
- Baseline lab results
- Environmental test results

**Labs to request:**
- Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)
- Liver enzymes (AST, ALT, GGT, bilirubin)
- Complete blood count (CBC)

      <AlertTriangle className="w-5 h-5" />
      Dangerous Drug Interactions
    </CardTitle>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    **NEVER combine with:**
    - **Statins** (simvastatin, lovastatin) → rhabdomyolysis risk
    - **Benzodiazepines** → excessive sedation
    - **Calcium channel blockers** → heart effects
    - **Warfarin** → bleeding risk
    - **Cisapride** → cardiac arrhythmias
    
    **Use caution with:**
    - SSRIs/SNRIs (may need dose adjustment)
    - Beta blockers
    - Proton pump inhibitors (reduce absorption)
    - Oral hypoglycemics
    - Immunosuppressants
    
    **Safe to use with:**
    - Binders (separate by 2+ hours)
    - Most supplements
    - Probiotics
    - Liver support supplements
    - Most antibiotics
    
    Always review with pharmacist!

## Optimizing Absorption

### The Acid Requirement

**Why acid matters:**
- Itraconazole needs pH &lt;3 to dissolve
- Stomach acid often low in mold patients
- Poor absorption = treatment failure

**Best practices:**
- Take with acidic beverages
- Avoid antacids within 2 hours
- Don't take with alkaline water
- Consider betaine HCl if needed

### The Fat Factor

**Fat increases absorption by:**
- Stimulating bile release
- Increasing dissolution
- Improving bioavailability
- 2-3x better absorption

**Ideal meal composition:**
- 20-30g fat minimum
- Include healthy fats
- Avoid taking on empty stomach
- Full meal better than snack

## Liver Protection Protocol

## Next Steps

After completing your itraconazole course:
- Continue binders for 2-3 more months
- Consider natural antifungals for maintenance
- Address biofilms if needed
- Support immune system
- Maintain mold-free environment

Continue to **Lesson 3: Other Prescription Options** if itraconazole isn't suitable, or **Lesson 5: Die-Off Management** to handle treatment reactions.

Remember: This is a powerful medication that can dramatically improve fungal colonization. Respect it, monitor carefully, and work closely with your provider.
