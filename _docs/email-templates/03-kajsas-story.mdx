Hi {{name}},

After 8 months of natural protocols that barely moved the needle, I was losing hope.

I'd tried everything:
- Every supplement recommended online
- Strict mold-free diet  
- Infrared sauna daily
- Multiple "detox" programs

My mycotoxin levels had dropped slightly, but I still felt terrible most days.

## The Turning Point

That's when I found a doctor willing to prescribe **cholestyramine (CSM)** and **itraconazole (Sporanox)**.

Within **one week** of starting these prescriptions, my symptoms began dissipating for the first time in almost a year.

## Why Prescriptions Made the Difference

**Cholestyramine** binds mycotoxins 4x more effectively than any natural binder. It's the gold standard that hospitals use for serious toxin exposure.

**Itraconazole** eliminated the fungal colonization in my sinuses that was continuously re-exposing me to toxins.

**The combination was life-changing.**

## But Here's the Key...

I had already spent 3 weeks preparing my drainage pathways. **This made all the difference.**

When I started CSM, instead of feeling worse (like I had with charcoal), I felt:
✅ Clearer thinking within days  
✅ More energy each week  
✅ Better sleep quality  
✅ Gradual return of my personality  

## Getting Your Own Prescriptions

{{#if high_risk}}
{{name}}, with your score of {{score}}/10 and your symptom pattern, prescription protocols could be exactly what you need.

The challenge is finding doctors who understand this approach.

**That's why I've created telehealth scripts** - the exact words to use with doctors to get these prescriptions, even if they're not familiar with mold illness.

{{#if moderate_risk}}
Depending on your test results and symptom severity, prescriptions might be worth exploring once you've optimized drainage pathways.

The key is timing and proper preparation.

## The Complete Protocol I Used

**Weeks 1-3:** Drainage preparation  
**Week 4:** Started CSM (¼ dose, titrated up slowly)  
**Week 6:** Added Sporanox  
**Week 8:** Felt 70% better  
**Week 12:** Tested negative for mycotoxins  

## What About Natural Options?

I still use and recommend natural supports:
- Sauna therapy (3-5x weekly)
- Targeted nutrition  
- Stress management
- Sleep optimization

**But for removing mycotoxins and eliminating fungal colonization, prescriptions were the game-changer.**

## Your Path Forward

The Mold Detox Mastery course includes:

✅ **Complete drainage preparation protocol**  
✅ **Prescription scripts for telehealth doctors**  
✅ **Exact dosing and titration schedules**  
✅ **Natural alternatives for those who prefer them**  
✅ **Safety monitoring and side effect management**  

Everything I wish I'd had when I started this journey.

P.S. {{name}}, my recovery wasn't perfect or linear. I had setbacks and difficult days. But having a clear protocol to follow made all the difference. You don't have to figure this out alone.
