## Measuring Your Recovery

After months of dedicated protocol work, you need objective measures to confirm your recovery and guide your long-term strategy. Retesting isn't just about numbers - it's about ensuring lasting health and preventing relapse.

> **Key Truth:** 70% of people who don't retest appropriately either stop treatment too early or continue unnecessarily.

## When to Retest: The Timeline

### VCS (Visual Contrast Sensitivity) Test
**First Retest:** 4 weeks after starting protocol
**Frequency:** Monthly during active treatment
**Cost:** $15 each time
**Purpose:** Track neurological improvement

**What to Expect:**
- Month 1: May worsen (Herx)
- Month 2: Slight improvement
- Month 3: Noticeable improvement
- Month 4-6: Approaching normal

### Urine Mycotoxin Testing
**First Retest:** NOT before 6 months
**Ideal Timing:** 6-7 months into protocol
**Cost:** $300-400
**Purpose:** Verify toxin reduction

**Why Wait 6+ Months:**
- Takes time to mobilize stored toxins
- Early testing can show false elevation
- Need sustained protocol for true reduction
- Insurance may cover if documented improvement

### Environmental Testing (ERMI/HERTSMI-2)
**When to Test:**
- After any remediation
- Before moving back to a space
- If symptoms return
- Annual prevention check

**Target Scores:**
- ERMI: Less than 2 (negative is better)
- HERTSMI-2: Less than 10

## Success Metrics: How to Know You're Recovering

### Objective Markers

#### Laboratory Improvements
✅ **Mycotoxin levels** decreased by 50%+
✅ **VCS test** normalizing or normal
✅ **Inflammatory markers** decreasing (C4a, TGF-β1)
✅ **White blood cell count** normalizing
✅ **Liver enzymes** improving

#### Functional Improvements
✅ **Energy** sustained throughout day
✅ **Sleep** restorative and consistent
✅ **Digestion** regular and comfortable
✅ **Exercise tolerance** increasing
✅ **Work capacity** returning

### Subjective Improvements

#### The 75% Rule
Consider yourself successfully recovering when symptoms improve by 75% or more:
- Brain fog lifting
- Mood stabilizing
- Pain decreasing
- Anxiety reducing
- Memory improving

#### Recovery Milestones
**Month 1-2:** Drainage improving, some days better
**Month 3-4:** More good days than bad
**Month 5-6:** Consistent improvement
**Month 7-9:** Feeling "normal" most days
**Month 10-12:** Resilience building

## Interpreting Your Retest Results

### Urine Mycotoxin Patterns

#### Best Case: All Toxins Decreased
- Continue current protocol 2-3 more months
- Then transition to maintenance
- Retest again in 6 months
- Celebrate your success!

#### Mixed Results: Some Better, Some Same
- Focus binders on unchanged toxins
- May need different binder types
- Consider adding antifungals
- Reassess environment
- Continue 3-4 months, retest

#### Concerning: Levels Increased
**Possible Reasons:**
- Still being exposed (check environment)
- Mobilizing stored toxins (actually good)
- Protocol too aggressive (adjust)
- New exposure source
- Need more drainage support

### VCS Test Interpretation

**Normal Result:**
- Both eyes pass
- Can reduce protocol intensity
- Maintain for 2-3 more months
- Focus on prevention

**Partial Improvement:**
- One eye passing or scores improving
- Continue full protocol
- Add brain support (melatonin, omega-3)
- Retest monthly

**No Improvement:**
- Check for ongoing exposure
- May have co-infections (Lyme, etc.)
- Consider MARCoNS testing
- Need more aggressive approach

## Transitioning to Maintenance

### The Step-Down Protocol

#### From Treatment to Maintenance (3-Month Transition)

**Month 1: Reduce Frequency**
- CSM: From 4x to 2x daily
- Antifungals: Every other day
- Continue all support supplements
- Maintain drainage support

**Month 2: Minimize Interventions**
- CSM: Once daily or every other day
- Stop antifungals unless needed
- Continue key supplements
- Weekly sauna minimum

**Month 3: Find Your Minimum**
- CSM: 2-3x per week or as needed
- Supplements: Core support only
- Sauna: 2-3x per week
- Focus on lifestyle factors

### Long-term Maintenance Protocol

#### Daily Essentials
- **Probiotics:** 50 billion CFU
- **Omega-3:** 2g
- **Vitamin D:** 5000 IU
