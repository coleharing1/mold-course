      {
        question: 'Who is this program for?',
        answer: 'This program is designed for anyone dealing with mold exposure or suspected mold illness, from those with mild symptoms to chronic cases. It&apos;s especially helpful if you&apos;re overwhelmed by conflicting information and want a clear, systematic approach to recovery.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Do I need to see a doctor first?',

      {
        question: 'How long does the program take?',
        answer: 'The average completion time is 3-6 months, but it&apos;s entirely self-paced. You have lifetime access, so you can move through the content at your own speed and revisit modules as needed.',

      },
      {
        question: 'Are the protocols safe?',
        answer: 'Safety is our top priority. We use a gated progression system that ensures you complete prerequisites before advancing to potentially challenging protocols. All recommendations include safety flags and prompts to consult healthcare providers when appropriate.',
      },
      {
        question: 'How current is the information?',
        answer: 'We review and update our content quarterly based on the latest research. All information includes citations and last-verified dates. You&apos;ll receive notifications when significant updates are made.',

      },
      {
        question: 'Can I download the content?',
        answer: 'Yes! You can download PDF summaries, audio files, and tool templates for offline use. The interactive tools require an internet connection to save your progress.',
      },
      {
        question: 'What if I need help?',
        answer: 'We offer email support, a comprehensive help center, and an optional community forum (Plus tier). Most questions are answered within 24 hours.',
