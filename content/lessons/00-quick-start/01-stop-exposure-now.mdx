# Stop Exposure NOW
*Emergency action required - you cannot heal while still being exposed*

<EvidenceBadge level="solid" />

## Why This Step Comes First

You cannot heal while still being exposed to mold. It's like trying to bail water out of a boat with a hole in it. No matter how many supplements you take or protocols you follow, continuous exposure will prevent recovery.

<DoThisNow

  action="If you've found mold or tested positive for mycotoxins, you must stop exposure immediately. This may mean leaving your home temporarily."
  urgency="critical"
  timeframe="Within 24 hours"
/>

## Document Everything First

Before you do anything else, create a record of what you're dealing with. This documentation is crucial for insurance claims, legal action, and medical treatment.

### Photo/Video Documentation

**What to capture:**
- ðŸ“¸ All visible mold growth
- ðŸ“¸ Water damage and stains
- ðŸ“¸ Damaged belongings
- ðŸ“¸ Overall room conditions
- ðŸ“¸ HVAC systems and vents

**How to document:**
- Use good lighting
- Include something for scale (ruler, coin)
- Take wide shots and close-ups
- Note date, time, and location
- Email copies to yourself immediately

**Storage tips:**
- Upload to cloud storage
- Email to trusted friend
- Save on multiple devices
- Keep originals safe

<SafetyFlag

## Emergency Packing Checklist

### What to Take (Essentials Only)

**Must-have items:**
- Essential medications
- Important documents (passport, insurance, medical records)
- Minimal clothing (wash everything later)
- Electronics in sealed plastic bags
- Toiletries and personal care items
- Phone chargers and essentials

**How to pack safely:**
- Use plastic bags for everything
- Seal items completely

### What to Leave Behind

**Do NOT take:**
- Porous items (books, papers, cardboard)
- Upholstered furniture
- Mattresses and pillows
- Anything with visible mold
- Items that smell musty
- Stuffed animals or fabric items
- Area rugs and carpets

**Why leave these:**
- Porous items trap spores
- Impossible to fully clean

- Not worth the health risk

## Cross-Contamination Prevention

### Protecting Your New Space

**Decontamination protocol:**
1. **Shower immediately** after leaving moldy environment
2. **Wash all clothing** in hot water with borax
3. **Wipe down** all non-porous items with hydrogen peroxide
4. **Quarantine** suspicious items in sealed bags
5. **Don't bring** anything that can't be thoroughly cleaned

**Critical rule:** When in doubt, throw it out. Your health is worth more than any possession.

### Personal Decontamination

**Every time you leave moldy space:**
- Remove shoes before entering car/new space
- Change clothes immediately
