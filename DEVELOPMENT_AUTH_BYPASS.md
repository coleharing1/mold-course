# ⚠️ DEVELOPMENT AUTHENTICATION BYPASS

## Current Status: AUTHENTICATION DISABLED FOR DEVELOPMENT

### What's Been Disabled
1. **Middleware Authentication** (`middleware.ts`)
   - All routes are currently accessible without login
   - Original auth logic is commented out but preserved

2. **Mock Session Active** (`lib/auth/mock-session.ts`)
   - Provides fake user session for development
   - Mock user: `dev@molddetoxmastery.com`

3. **API Routes Using Mock Data**
   - `/api/progress` - Returns mock progress data
   - `/api/onboarding` - May need mock updates
   - `/api/checkout` - May need mock updates

### Files Modified
- `middleware.ts` - Auth middleware disabled
- `lib/auth/mock-session.ts` - Mock session provider (NEW)
- `app/api/progress/route.ts` - Using mock session

### How to Access Protected Routes
Simply navigate to any route - no login required:
- http://localhost:3005/dashboard
- http://localhost:3005/modules
- http://localhost:3005/tools
- http://localhost:3005/onboarding

### Re-enabling Authentication (Phase 3)

#### Step 1: Remove Mock Session File
```bash
rm lib/auth/mock-session.ts
```

#### Step 2: Restore Middleware
In `middleware.ts`, uncomment the original auth code and remove the bypass.

#### Step 3: Update API Routes
Search for `TODO: RE-ENABLE` comments and restore original auth checks:
```bash
grep -r "TODO: RE-ENABLE" app/api
```

#### Step 4: Test Authentication
1. Try accessing `/dashboard` - should redirect to `/signin`
2. Create account and sign in
3. Verify session persistence
4. Test protected API routes

### Why This Was Done
- Speeds up development by removing login friction
- Allows testing of all features without account setup
- Eliminates session timeout interruptions
- Simplifies development workflow

### Security Note
⚠️ **NEVER DEPLOY WITH AUTH DISABLED**
- This is for local development only
- Production deployment MUST have authentication enabled
- All TODOs must be resolved before Phase 3 deployment

### Related Phase 3 Tasks
Added to `_docs/phases/phase-3-scale.md`:
- [ ] RE-ENABLE AUTHENTICATION - Remove mock-session.ts, restore middleware.ts
- [ ] Remove all dev bypasses - Search for "TODO: RE-ENABLE" comments
