  <p className="font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-2">Quick Start in 50 Words:</p>
  <p className="text-blue-800">
    Stop mold exposure immediately - check home, office, car. Open drainage pathways for 2-4 weeks with daily bowel movements, hydration, and sweating. Only then start binders (charcoal, chlorella, or prescription CSM). Recovery takes 3-6 months minimum. Never skip drainage prep or symptoms will worsen dramatically.

## Your 5-Step Quick Start to Mold Recovery

<ModuleQuickStart />

If you suspect mold exposure or have tested positive for mycotoxins, these are the **exact 5 steps** you need to take right now. This guide is based on real recovery experiences and proven protocols.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Warning:** You cannot heal while still being exposed to mold. Step 1 is non-negotiable.

## Step 1: Identify Your Exposure ‚úÖ

**Check ALL frequent environments** - the first and most crucial step.

### Where to Look:
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Your Home** - Check every room, especially bathrooms, basements, attics
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Your Office** - Does your health improve on weekends/vacations?
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Your Car** - Check AC vents, carpets, trunk for musty smells
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Other Spaces** - Gym, friend's house, anywhere you spend regular time

### Signs You've Been Exposed:
- You smell a musty, earthy odor
- Visible mold on walls, ceilings, or vents
- Past water damage (even if "fixed")
- Symptoms worsen in certain locations
- Others in the same space have similar symptoms

  title="Immediate Action Required"
  action="If you find mold, document it with photos and either remediate properly or leave the environment. Moving may be your best option."
  urgency="high"
/>

## Step 2: Reduce Further Exposure ‚úÖ

If you can't leave immediately, minimize exposure while planning your exit.

### Immediate Actions:
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Use air purifiers** with HEPA filters in bedroom and main living areas
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Control moisture** - Use dehumidifiers to keep humidity below 50%
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Clean strategically** - Never use bleach (makes it worse), use proper mold cleaning products
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Protect yourself** - Wear N95 mask in moldy areas
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Seal off areas** - Use plastic sheeting to isolate contaminated spaces

### Test Your Environment:
- **ERMI Test** - Score should be less than 2
- **HERTSMI-2** - Score should be less than 10
- **DIY Options** - Petri dish tests from Amazon

## Step 3: Prepare Your Body for Detox ‚úÖ

  type="critical"
  message="You MUST open drainage pathways for 2-4 weeks BEFORE starting binders. Skipping this step can cause severe Herxheimer reactions and make symptoms dramatically worse."
/>

### The 5 Drainage Pathways (Track Daily):
1. **üí© Bowel Movements** - MUST have 1-3 daily before starting binders
   - Magnesium citrate before bed
   - Vitamin C powder if needed
   - If constipated, DO NOT start binders yet

2. **ü´ò Liver & Gallbladder** - Support bile flow
   - Bitter foods (dandelion, artichokes)
   - Castor oil packs 20-30 min daily
   - Milk thistle or ox bile supplements

3. **üíß Kidneys** - Flush toxins through urine
   - Half your body weight in ounces of water
   - Add electrolytes or sea salt
   - Dandelion or nettle tea

4. **üèÉ Lymphatic System** - Move stagnant toxins
   - Dry brushing before showers
   - Rebounding or light exercise
   - Lymphatic massage

5. **üí¶ Sweating** - Eliminate through skin
   - Infrared sauna (start 5 min, work to 45 min)
   - Exercise to sweat 3-4x weekly
   - Epsom salt baths

> **Readiness Check:** Only proceed to Step 4 when you're pooping daily, sweating regularly, and well-hydrated for at least 7 days.

## Step 4: Start Detoxing Safely ‚úÖ

Once drainage is open, begin removing mycotoxins with the right approach.

### Binder Introduction (Start Low & Slow):
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Week 1-2:** Start with ONE binder at low dose
  - Activated charcoal (500mg) OR
  - Chlorella (500mg) OR
  - Modified citrus pectin (5g)
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Week 3-4:** If tolerated, increase dose gradually
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Week 5+:** Consider prescription binders (Cholestyramine)

### Critical Binder Rules:
- Take 30-60 min before meals or 2+ hours after
- Separate from ALL medications and supplements by 2+ hours
- Drink extra water to prevent constipation
- If symptoms worsen (Herx reaction), reduce dose

### Most Effective Protocol (Prescription):

<div className="flex items-center gap-2 mb-2">
  <span className="font-semibold">Cholestyramine (CSM) - The gold standard</span>
  <EvidenceBadge level="solid" />
</div>

- 4g packets, 4x daily for 30 days
- Then 2x daily for maintenance
- Requires doctor prescription (use telehealth if needed)

**Antifungals** (Only after binders tolerated):
- Itraconazole 100mg 2x daily
- Natural alternative: Neem, Biopure O3

## Step 5: Maintain Long-Term Prevention ‚úÖ

Recovery takes 3-6 months minimum. Stay consistent with these practices.

### Testing Schedule:
- ‚òëÔ∏è **VCS Test** - Every 3 months ($10-15)
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Urine Mycotoxin** - Retest at 6-7 months ($200-400)
- ‚òëÔ∏è **Environment** - Test any new living/working space

### Daily Maintenance:
- Continue sauna therapy 3-5x weekly
- Maintain clean, mold-free diet
- Keep air purifiers running
- Monitor humidity levels
- Track symptoms for patterns

### Success Indicators:
- Mycotoxin levels drop to "normal range"
- Symptoms improve by 50%+ within 3 months
- Energy and brain fog significantly better
- Can tolerate more foods and environments
