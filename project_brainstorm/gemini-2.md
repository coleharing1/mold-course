Of course! Transforming your PDF into a simple, high-value online course is a great idea. It allows for a more dynamic and engaging learning experience than a static document.

Here is a recommended layout, structure, and feature set for your "Mold Detox" online course, designed to be built with an AI-assisted tool like Cursor.

***

### **Overall Course Structure & Philosophy**

The goal is to guide the user step-by-step, from understanding the problem to taking actionable steps toward recovery. Instead of just presenting information, you'll be creating a guided journey. The course should feel supportive, clear, and empowering.

**Core Idea:** Each module builds on the last. The user should feel a sense of progress as they move through the material.

### **Recommended Course Pages & Layout**

You can instruct Cursor AI to build the basic structure for these pages. For example, a prompt could be: *"Generate a responsive webpage layout using HTML and CSS for an online course. It should have a main navigation header, a sidebar for course modules and lessons, and a central content area."*

#### **1. Welcome / Course Dashboard**

This is the first page users see after enrolling.

* **Features:**
    * **Welcome Message:** A brief, encouraging text or audio message welcoming the user.
    * **Course Overview:** A short summary of what they will learn and achieve.
    * **"Start Here" Button:** A clear call-to-action that takes them to the first module.
    * **Progress Tracker:** A visual bar showing their completion percentage (e.g., "You are 25% of the way through!").
    * **Module Outline:** A clickable list of all modules.

#### **2. Module & Lesson Pages**

This is the core of your course. The layout should be consistent across all lessons for a clean user experience.

* **Layout:**
    * **Left Sidebar:** Navigation tree showing all modules and the lessons within them. The current lesson is highlighted.
    * **Main Content Area:** This is where the lesson content lives.
    * **Top of Page:** Lesson title.
    * **Bottom of Page:** "Mark as Complete" button and navigation buttons for "Previous Lesson" and "Next Lesson".

* **Lesson Content Features (The "More Than a PDF" Part):**
    * **Audio Narration:** At the top of each text-based lesson, embed an audio player. Record yourself reading the lesson text clearly. This adds a personal touch and caters to auditory learners without showing your face.
    * **Interactive Checklists:** For sections that involve action steps (like "Opening Drainage Pathways"), use interactive checklists that users can tick off.
    * **Toggle/Accordion Sections:** For dense topics, use accordions that users can click to expand and reveal more information. This prevents overwhelming walls of text. (e.g., "Click here to learn about the 3 types of mycotoxins").
    * **Simple Quizzes:** At the end of each module, create a short 3-5 question quiz to reinforce key concepts. This isn't for a grade, but for self-assessment.
    * **"Your Action Plan" Boxes:** At the end of key lessons or modules, have a distinctively styled box with a clear heading. This section summarizes the immediate, actionable steps the user should take based on the information they just learned.
    * **Screencast Videos:** For Module 6 ("Building Your Team"), you can record your screen (using a tool like Loom or OBS) showing how to navigate the IICRC and ACAC websites to find a certified professional. This provides immense practical value.

#### **3. Resources Hub**

This is a critical page that makes your course far more valuable than a PDF. It's a single, well-organized place for all external links and downloadable materials.

* **Features:**
    * **Categorized Links:** Organize links under clear headings:
        * Environmental Testing (links to ERMI, HERTSMI-2 labs)
        * Lab Testing (links to urine mycotoxin test providers)
        * Recommended Binders & Supplements (with disclaimers)
        * Find a Professional (links to IICRC, ACAC, Functional Medicine directories)
    * **Downloadable Cheatsheets:** Convert key lists or concepts from your guide into one-page, printable PDFs.
        * "Mold Detox Grocery List"
        * "Symptoms Checklist"
        * "Questions to Ask a Mold Inspector"

#### **4. Community/Discussion Page (Optional but Recommended)**

This fosters a sense of community and allows users to ask questions.

* **Features:**
    * **Simple Forum or Comment Board:** A single page where users can post questions or share their experiences. You can act as the moderator to answer questions and guide the discussion. This adds a huge layer of value and support.
