## Module Overview

Testing can be expensive and confusing. This module helps you choose the right tests at the right time, interpret results, and avoid wasting money on unnecessary testing. You'll learn both environmental and medical testing options to create a complete picture of your mold exposure and its impact on your health.

<SafetyFlag 
  type="info"
  message="While some tests like ERMI are debated in conventional medicine, they are standard in environmental medicine and mold illness treatment. Work with a mold-literate practitioner when possible."

## What You'll Learn

This module contains 6 comprehensive lessons covering all aspects of mold testing:

### Lesson 1: Environmental Testing Overview (15 min)
Understanding home and building tests - ERMI, HERTSMI-2, and when professional testing is necessary.

### Lesson 2: DIY Testing Methods (10 min)
Affordable testing you can do yourself including petri dishes, tape lifts, and gravity plates.

### Lesson 3: Medical Testing - Mycotoxins (15 min)
The gold standard for measuring your body's mold toxin burden through urine testing.

### Lesson 4: Biomarker Testing (15 min)
Blood tests that indicate CIRS/mold illness including C4a, TGF-β1, MMP-9, and hormone markers.

### Lesson 5: VCS Testing (10 min)
Visual Contrast Sensitivity as a quick, cheap screening tool for biotoxin illness.

### Lesson 6: Genetic Testing - HLA-DR (10 min)
Understanding genetic susceptibility and why 24% of the population can't naturally clear biotoxins.

## Key Testing Priorities

<div className="bg-blue-50 p-4 rounded-lg mb-6">
  <h3 className="font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-2">Your Testing Roadmap</h3>
  
  **Priority 1: Essential Tests ($330-415)**
  - VCS Test - $15 (immediate screening)
  - Urine Mycotoxin Test - $300-400 (body burden)
  
  **Priority 2: Environmental ($155-350)**
  - HERTSMI-2 - $155 (budget option)
  - OR ERMI - $290 (comprehensive)
  
  **Priority 3: If Budget Allows ($300-600)**
  - C4a and TGF-β1 - $150-200
  - HLA-DR genetic test - $150-200
  - Full biomarker panel - $400-600
</div>

## Understanding the Tests

### Environmental Testing
- **ERMI/HERTSMI-2:** DNA-based tests that identify and quantify mold species
- **DIY Methods:** Petri dishes and tape lifts for initial screening
- **Professional Inspection:** When you need comprehensive assessment

### Medical Testing
- **Mycotoxins:** Direct measurement of mold toxins in your body
- **Biomarkers:** Inflammatory markers showing how your body is responding
- **VCS:** Neurological screening that takes 15 minutes
- **Genetics:** One-time test revealing your susceptibility

## Critical Information

<EvidenceBadge level="solid" />

### Interpretation Thresholds
- **ERMI:** Score less than 2 safe, greater than 10 problematic
- **HERTSMI-2:** Score less than 10 acceptable, greater than 15 hazardous
- **C4a:** Normal less than 2830, mold illness often greater than 10,000
- **VCS:** Column C & D deficits most specific for biotoxins
- **HLA-DR:** 4-3-53 and 11-3-52B worst for mold susceptibility

### Insurance Coverage Tips
- Use CPT codes provided in lessons
- Submit as "immunoassay" or "inflammation panel"
- Use HSA/FSA funds when insurance denies
- Appeal with environmental test documentation

## When to Test

### Initial Testing
- Start immediately with VCS ($15)
- Order mycotoxin and environmental tests together
- Add biomarkers if budget allows

### Follow-Up Testing
- VCS monthly during treatment
- Mycotoxins at 6 months (not before)
- Biomarkers every 3 months
- Environmental after remediation

## Next Steps

Once you have your test results, continue to **Module 03: Open Drainage Pathways** to prepare your body for safe detoxification.
