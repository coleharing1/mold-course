## 2025-08-11 - Critical Phase 1 Infrastructure Complete (Days 10-12, 18-19)

### Summary
Completed critical Phase 1 infrastructure including dashboard widgets, module gating logic, and the essential Drainage Readiness Score tool. This tool is the primary safety gate preventing users from starting binders before their drainage pathways are ready, which could cause severe detox reactions. All components align with Kajsa's protocol requiring 80% drainage readiness for 7 consecutive days before binder access.

### Dashboard Widgets Created (Day 10)
- `components/dashboard/retest-countdown.tsx` - VCS and mycotoxin testing schedule tracker
- `components/dashboard/daily-tip.tsx` - Rotating daily tips with actionable mold recovery advice
- `components/dashboard/community-highlight.tsx` - Success stories and community engagement
- Updated `app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx` - Integrated all new widgets in responsive grid

### Module Infrastructure (Day 11-12)
- `lib/modules/prerequisite-checker.ts` - Enforces module dependencies and safety requirements
- `lib/modules/gating-logic.ts` - Comprehensive gating system with critical safety gates
  - Implements 80% drainage for 7 days requirement before binders
  - Tracks completion percentages for module unlocking
  - Provides user-friendly unlock instructions

### Drainage Readiness Score Tool (Day 18-19) - CRITICAL SAFETY FEATURE
- `app/(app)/tools/drainage-readiness/page.tsx` - Main tool page with safety warnings
- `components/tools/drainage/daily-form.tsx` - 10-metric assessment form with tooltips
- `components/tools/drainage/trend-chart.tsx` - Visual progress tracking with target lines
- `components/tools/drainage/suggestions.tsx` - Personalized improvement recommendations
- `lib/calculations/drainage-score.ts` - Weighted scoring algorithm (bowels 20%, liver 15%, hydration 12%)
- `lib/calculations/rolling-average.ts` - 7-day rolling average calculations
- `app/api/tools/drainage/route.ts` - Database persistence and badge awarding

### Key Safety Features Implemented
- **Hard Gate on Binders**: Module 04 (Binders) locked until 80% drainage for 7 days
- **Visual Safety Alerts**: Red warnings when drainage is insufficient
- **Progress Tracking**: Clear countdown showing days until binder unlock
- **Weighted Scoring**: Critical pathways (bowels, liver, hydration) have higher weights
- **Badge System**: Awards "drainage-unlocked" badge when ready for binders
- **Database Integration**: Saves to Readiness table for module gating checks

### Technical Highlights
- All components use TypeScript with proper interfaces
- Chart visualizations with Recharts library
- LocalStorage + database persistence for offline capability
- Responsive design works on all device sizes
- Real-time score calculation and trend analysis

### Phase 1 Progress Update
- **Day 10**: ✅ All dashboard widgets complete (9/9 tasks)
- **Day 11-12**: ✅ Module infrastructure complete (4/4 tasks)
- **Day 18-19**: ✅ Drainage Readiness tool complete (8/8 tasks)
- **Critical Path Clear**: Users can now safely progress through detox protocol

### Safety Impact
This update ensures users cannot access potentially harmful binder protocols without proper preparation. The drainage tool provides clear guidance on improving each pathway, tracks progress over time, and only unlocks advanced protocols when it's safe to proceed. This aligns perfectly with Kajsa's experience that rushing into binders without drainage preparation causes severe detox reactions.

### Next Priority Tasks
- Day 20: Binder Timing Planner (important but not blocking)
- Day 21: Resources Vault (nice to have)
- Day 22-23: Email & Analytics (can be done in parallel)
- Phase 2: Can begin module content while completing remaining Phase 1 polish

## 2025-08-09 - Initial Project Setup and Documentation Generation

### Summary
Complete project initialization and documentation generation based on Opus4-Project-overview.md specifications. Created comprehensive startup documentation following GROK-NEW-PROJECT-SETUP.md guide.

### Files Created
1. **Documentation Structure** (_docs/)
   - `project-overview.md` - Aligned with Opus4 product vision and KPIs
   - `user-flow.md` - Detailed user journeys from landing to completion
   - `tech-stack.md` - Updated to match Opus4 specifications (PostHog, Resend, Bunny/Mux)
   - `ui-rules.md` - Health-conscious design principles
   - `theme-rules.md` - Calming, professional design system
   - `project-rules.md` - AI-first development practices

2. **Phase Documents** (_docs/phases/)
   - `phase-0-setup.md` - 40+ task checklist for project initialization
   - `phase-1-frontend-foundation.md` - MVP with 3 modules, 3 tools (4 weeks)
   - `phase-2-frontend-features.md` - Full 10 modules, 9 tools, community (4 weeks)
   - `phase-3-scale.md` - Advanced features, Supabase migration (4 weeks)

### Key Decisions
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 14+ with App Router, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Framer Motion
- **Content**: MDX for lessons with Contentlayer for typed models
- **Database Strategy**: SQLite for development (Phase 1-2), Supabase for production (Phase 3)
- **Payments**: Stripe with three tiers (Core $149-199, Plus $47-59/mo, VIP $997+)
- **Module Gating**: Drainage readiness required before binders, strict sequencing
- **Evidence System**: Solid/Emerging/Controversial badges with safety flags

### Architecture Established
```
/(marketing)     - Public pages (landing, pricing, preview)
/(app)          - Protected app (dashboard, modules, tools)
/(auth)         - Authentication flows
/content        - MDX modules and email templates
/components     - Reusable UI components
/lib            - Business logic and utilities
```

## Maintenance Guidelines

### When to Update
- After every 5-10 file modifications
- At the end of each work session
- Before switching to a different feature
- After major decisions or pivots
- When encountering and solving significant problems

### What to Include
- File changes with purpose
- Architectural decisions
- Problem-solution pairs
- Dependencies added/removed
- Configuration changes
- API endpoint changes
- Database schema updates
- External service integrations

### How to Update
1. Add new entry at the top (reverse chronological)
2. Use consistent date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
3. Be concise but complete
4. Include context for future readers
5. Reference relevant documentation
6. Note any blockers or concerns

### Why This Matters
- AI assistants lose context between sessions
- Team members need to understand recent changes
- Helps identify patterns and recurring issues
- Documents the evolution of decisions
- Provides audit trail for debugging
- Enables efficient handoffs between developers
