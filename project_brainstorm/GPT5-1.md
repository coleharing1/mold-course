Love it. If the goal is true, working expertise (not internet folklore), we’ll build you a science‑first, practical playbook and stress‑test it against mainstream guidance *and* popular “mold detox” protocols.

Quick check before we dive: are you learning this mainly for your own recovery, or to teach others (e.g., a course/clinic)? One choice changes how deep we go on risk, liability, and evidence tiers.

Here’s the 10,000‑ft map we’ll use:

**What experts actually agree on (solid ground)**

* Fix moisture and remove moldy materials → symptoms often improve without fancy testing. Control water within 24–48h; clean hard surfaces with detergent, discard porous items that stayed wet, and don’t rely on bleach as a routine step. Moisture control is the key. ([US EPA][1])
* Routine home “mold tests” aren’t needed to decide whether to clean; if you see/smell mold or dampness, fix it. ([US EPA][2])
* Health effects with the strongest evidence: allergy/asthma, respiratory symptoms, and exacerbations in susceptible people; broader complaints are plausible but less consistently proven. ([National Academies Press][3], [WHO Apps][4])

**What’s debated (and how to think about it)**

* **ERMI/HERTSMI:** ERMI was created as a *research* index and is *not* recommended for routine home decisions. If used, it should be in a research/consulting context with on‑site moisture inspection. ([US EPA][5], [US EPA][6])
* **Urine mycotoxin tests:** CDC/FDA do *not* endorse them for diagnosing “mold illness”; mycotoxins can appear at low levels in healthy people and clinical cutoffs aren’t established. ([CDC][7])
* **“Detox” protocols (binders/antifungals):** Off‑label binders like cholestyramine are central in Shoemaker/CIRS protocols; animal data show it can bind ochratoxin A and increase fecal excretion, but robust human trials for indoor‑mold illness are limited. Itraconazole is a real antifungal—effective for specific fungal infections—but requires medical supervision/liver monitoring and is not a general “detox.” ([PubMed][8], [PubMed Central][9], [FDA Access Data][10])

**A safe‑first, evidence‑weighted starter playbook**

1. **Eliminate exposure**: find and fix liquid water, keep RH <60%, ventilate, and use HEPA filtration during/after remediation. Discard porous materials that stayed wet; clean hard surfaces with detergent; reserve biocides/bleach for special cases. ([US EPA][1])
2. **Assess buildings, not just air**: visual/moisture assessment beats spore counts for actionability; NIOSH has a simple dampness checklist. ([CDC][11])
3. **Medical path**: if you have respiratory/allergic disease, treat those conditions per standard care while exposure is corrected. Be cautious with urine mycotoxin tests and interpret “detox” claims in light of limited human evidence. ([CDC][7])
4. **If exploring CIRS‑style protocols**: know the rationale, dosing, and monitoring (e.g., fat‑soluble vitamin timing with cholestyramine; boxed warnings and drug interactions for itraconazole). Use them under a clinician’s care. ([survivingmold.com][12], [FDA Access Data][13])
5. **Retest wisely**: For buildings, verify the moisture fix and cleanliness rather than chasing numbers; for health, track symptoms and standard labs directed by your clinician. ([US EPA][1])

**How we’ll study (fast, structured, and practical)**

* Module 1: Building science 101 for mold (moisture sources, RH targets, materials triage). ([US EPA][1])
* Module 2: Health effects—what’s proven vs. proposed. ([National Academies Press][3], [WHO Apps][4])
* Module 3: Testing—when to use inspections, ERMI (research only), and why to be cautious with urine mycotoxin tests. ([US EPA][5], [CDC][7])
* Module 4: Remediation playbook for homes/schools (roles, PPE, clearance). ([US EPA][14])
* Module 5: Therapies—evidence tiers for binders, antifungals, sauna/exercise/sleep, with safety notes. ([PubMed][8], [FDA Access Data][10])

We can also cross‑reference your uploaded guide as a practical, step‑by‑step resource and annotate it with evidence ratings and safety flags as we go.&#x20;

Your move: are we aiming this for **your own recovery** or to **teach others** (e.g., a course)?
