## Binder Dose Calculations

### Cholestyramine (CSM)
**Standard Protocol (per Dr. Shoemaker):**
- **Target dose:** 4 grams, 4 times daily
- **Total daily dose:** 16 grams
- **Not weight-dependent**

**Sensitive Individual Modification:**
- **Week 1:** 1 gram, 2 times daily
- **Week 2:** 2 grams, 2 times daily  
- **Week 3:** 3 grams, 2 times daily
- **Week 4:** 4 grams, 2 times daily
- **Week 5+:** 4 grams, 4 times daily

**Calculation:**
```
Base dose = 4g x 4 times = 16g daily
Sensitive start = 2g daily, increase by 2g weekly
Maximum safe dose = 24g daily (rarely needed)
```

### Activated Charcoal
**Weight-based dosing:**
- **Standard:** 1-2 grams per 100 lbs body weight
- **Acute exposure:** Up to 4 grams per 100 lbs

**Calculation:**
```
Your weight (lbs) ÷ 100 = multiplier
Multiplier × 1-2g = daily dose range
Example: 150 lbs ÷ 100 = 1.5
1.5 × 1-2g = 1.5-3g daily
```

### Clay Binders (Bentonite, Zeolite)
**General dosing:**
- **Bentonite:** 1-2 grams daily, not weight-dependent
- **Zeolite:** 5-10 grams daily, not weight-dependent
- **Start low:** Begin with 25-50% of target dose

## Monitoring and Adjustment

### Lab Tests for Monitoring
**Baseline (before starting):**

- Liver function tests
- Vitamin D, B12, folate

**Follow-up (after 3-6 months):**
- Repeat baseline tests
- Add specific vitamins/minerals being supplemented
- Adjust doses based on results

### Dose Adjustment Guidelines
**Increase dose if:**
- Lab values still low
- Symptoms not improving
- Good tolerance to current dose

**Decrease dose if:**
- Lab values optimal or high
- Side effects present
- Symptoms resolved

**Timing for adjustments:**
- Wait 4-6 weeks between changes
- Change one supplement at a time
- Monitor response carefully

Remember: These calculations provide starting points for supplement dosing. Individual needs vary significantly based on genetics, health status, medications, and other factors. Always work with a qualified healthcare provider for personalized recommendations and monitoring.
