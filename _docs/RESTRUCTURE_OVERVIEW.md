# Mold Detox Mastery - Comprehensive Restructure Overview

## Executive Summary
This restructure aligns the platform precisely with Kajsa's proven mold detox protocol, emphasizing her specific timeline, prescription-first approach, and safety gates. The goal is to transform the current educational platform into a prescriptive, results-driven recovery system.

## Core Philosophy Shift
**From:** General education about mold illness  
**To:** Kajsa's exact recovery protocol with interactive tracking

## 1. Module Architecture Restructure

### Current Structure (Problematic)
```
00 - Quick Start Guide ✓
01 - Understanding Mold (too theoretical)
02 - Exposure Assessment (correct)
03+ - Generic modules
```

### New Structure (Aligned with Kajsa's Timeline)
```
Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
├── 00 - Quick Start (5 Essential Steps)
├── 01 - Identify Your Exposure 
└── 02 - Testing & Diagnosis

Phase 2: Preparation (Weeks 1-4)
├── 03 - Open Drainage Pathways
└── 04 - Mycotoxin Analysis & Binder Selection

Phase 3: Active Detox (Weeks 5-8)
├── 05 - Binder Protocols (CSM Focus)
└── 06 - Managing Herx Reactions

Phase 4: Advanced Detox (Weeks 7-11)
├── 07 - Antifungal Protocols (Itraconazole)
└── 08 - Supporting Modalities

Phase 5: Maintenance (Months 3-6)
├── 09 - Diet & Nutrition
├── 10 - Retesting & Progress
└── 11 - Long-term Prevention
```

## 2. Content Depth Requirements

### Each Module Must Include:

#### A. Protocol Specifics
- **Exact dosing** (e.g., CSM: 4g packets, 4x daily)
- **Timing charts** (30 min before meals, 2hr from supplements)
- **Duration** (30 days initial, 2 weeks maintenance)
- **Side effects** and management strategies

#### B. Dual Path System
```
For Each Protocol:
├── Prescription Path (Recommended)
│   ├── Medications needed
│   ├── How to obtain (telehealth scripts)
│   ├── Insurance/cost considerations
│   └── Advocacy templates
└── Natural Path (Alternative)
    ├── Supplement alternatives
    ├── Expected timeline (longer)
    ├── Cost comparison
    └── Effectiveness notes
```

#### C. Safety Gates
- **Hard stops** before progression
- **Readiness assessments** with specific metrics
- **Override warnings** requiring acknowledgment

## 3. Interactive Tools Restructure

### Priority 1: Core Protocol Tools

#### A. Mycotoxin-Binder Matcher
**Purpose:** Match urine test results to specific binders  
**Data Source:** Page 14 of Kajsa's guide  
**Features:**
- Input mycotoxins from test results
- Output ranked binder recommendations
- Dosing calculator based on body weight
- Timing scheduler with medication conflicts

#### B. Enhanced Drainage Readiness Tracker
**Purpose:** Gate access to binder protocols  
**Metrics:** Track Kajsa's 5 pathways daily
```javascript
const drainagePathways = {
  bowelMovements: { target: "1-3 daily", weight: 30 },
  liverSupport: { target: "daily support", weight: 20 },
  lymphMovement: { target: "daily activity", weight: 20 },
  hydration: { target: "½ body weight in oz", weight: 15 },
  sweating: { target: "3-4x weekly", weight: 15 }
}
```

#### C. CSM Timing Calculator
**Purpose:** Manage complex medication/supplement spacing  
**Features:**
- Visual timeline of daily dosing
- Conflict detection (fat-soluble vitamins, thyroid meds)
- Push notifications for dose timing
- Adjustment for Welchol combination therapy

### Priority 2: Support Tools

#### D. Herx Severity Monitor
**Inputs:** Daily symptom intensity (1-10 scale)  
**Outputs:** Protocol adjustments, slowdown recommendations  
**Alerts:** Red flags requiring medical attention

#### E. Retesting Scheduler
**Timeline:**
- VCS: Every 3 months
- Urine Mycotoxin: 6-7 months
- Progress photos: Monthly
**Integration:** Calendar sync, cost tracking, result comparison

## 4. User Journey Restructure
