# Medical Testing - Mycotoxins
*The gold standard for measuring your body's mold toxin burden*

<EvidenceBadge level="solid" />

## Why Mycotoxin Testing is Essential

Urine mycotoxin testing directly measures the toxic load in your body. Unlike environmental tests that show exposure, mycotoxin tests reveal what's actually affecting your health.

**Key benefits:**
- Confirms mold illness diagnosis
- Identifies specific toxins for targeted treatment
- Provides baseline for tracking progress
- Validates symptoms aren't "in your head"
- Guides binder selection

## Understanding Mycotoxin Types

### The Most Common Culprits

| Mycotoxin | Source Molds | Health Effects | What It Means |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Ochratoxin A** | Aspergillus, Penicillium | Kidney damage, immune suppression | Most common finding, indicates water-damaged building |
| **Aflatoxins** | Aspergillus | Liver damage, cancer risk | Often from food AND environmental exposure |
| **Trichothecenes** | Stachybotrys (black mold) | Severe neurotoxicity, immune damage | Indicates serious exposure, immediate action needed |
| **Gliotoxin** | Aspergillus, Candida | Immune suppression | May indicate fungal colonization |
| **Citrinin** | Penicillium | Kidney toxicity | Common in older buildings |
| **Zearalenone** | Fusarium | Hormone disruption | Can cause estrogen-like effects |

### Which Binders Work for Each

**Matching toxins to treatment:**
- **Ochratoxin A:** Cholestyramine, activated charcoal
- **Aflatoxins:** Cholestyramine, chlorella
- **Trichothecenes:** Cholestyramine, bentonite clay
- **Gliotoxin:** NAC, activated charcoal
- **Zearalenone:** Glucomannan, activated charcoal

## Proper Test Preparation

### Standard Collection (No Provocation)

**Best for:** Initial testing, seeing baseline levels

**Protocol:**
1. First morning urine
2. Mid-stream collection
3. No supplements night before
4. Normal hydration
5. Ship same day

### Glutathione Challenge (Optional)

**Best for:** Long-term exposure, stored toxins

**Protocol:**
1. **Night before:** 500mg liposomal glutathione
2. **Morning:** 500mg glutathione again
3. **Wait 30 minutes**
4. **Collect:** First morning urine
5. **Purpose:** Mobilizes stored mycotoxins

### Pre-Test Checklist

**Week before testing:**
- [ ] Stop antifungals
- [ ] Avoid saunas
- [ ] Normal diet
- [ ] Document symptoms
- [ ] Note medications

**Night before:**
- [ ] Normal hydration
- [ ] No alcohol
- [ ] Glutathione if doing challenge
- [ ] Set morning alarm
- [ ] Have kit ready

## Interpreting Your Results

### Understanding Reference Ranges

**Key insight:** "Normal" doesn't mean safe

**Interpretation levels:**
- **Within range:** May still need treatment if symptomatic
- **2-3x above:** Definite treatment needed
- **3-10x above:** Aggressive protocol required
- **>10x above:** Immediate intervention, find exposure

### What Different Patterns Mean

**Single high toxin:**
- Specific exposure source
- Targeted treatment possible
- Better prognosis

**Multiple elevated toxins:**
- Chronic or severe exposure
- Multiple sources possible
- Longer treatment needed

**Trichothecenes present:**
- Black mold exposure confirmed
- Immediate remediation critical
- Aggressive treatment required

**All toxins elevated:**
- Overwhelming exposure
- Poor detox genetics likely
- Comprehensive approach needed

## Retesting Timeline

### When NOT to Retest

**First 3 months:**
- Levels may spike (mobilization)
- Waste of money
- Can be discouraging
- Wait for treatment to work

### Optimal Retesting Schedule

**3-6 months:** First retest
- Shows treatment effectiveness
- Adjust protocol if needed
- Expect 30-50% reduction

**6-12 months:** Clearance test
- Looking for normal ranges
- Confirms recovery
- Guides maintenance plan

**Annual:** Monitoring
- Ensure no re-exposure
- Catch problems early
- Peace of mind
