objectives:
  - "Master infrared sauna protocols for mycotoxin elimination"
  - "Understand HBOT for mold illness recovery"
  - "Learn peptide protocols for immune and gut repair"
  - "Implement nasal care and sinus protocols"
  - "Optimize sleep for glymphatic drainage"
tldr: "Supportive modalities accelerate recovery from mold illness. Infrared sauna (110-130°F start, build to 30-45 min) directly eliminates mycotoxins through sweat. HBOT reduces inflammation and supports mitochondria. Peptides like BPC-157 repair damage. Combined with core treatment, these tools significantly improve outcomes."
keyTakeaways:
  - "Infrared sauna is one of the most effective mycotoxin elimination tools"
  - "Start all modalities slowly and increase gradually"
  - "HBOT helps with neurological symptoms and energy"
  - "Peptides can accelerate gut and immune recovery"
  - "Multiple modalities work synergistically"

## Infrared Sauna - The Gold Standard

### Why Sauna Works for Mold Illness

Infrared sauna is perhaps the single most effective supportive therapy for mold illness because:

1. **Direct Elimination**: Mycotoxins are excreted through sweat
2. **Bypasses Liver**: Reduces burden on detox pathways
3. **Heat Shock Proteins**: Activate cellular repair mechanisms
4. **Improved Circulation**: Enhances toxin mobilization
5. **Mitochondrial Support**: Stimulates energy production

- Monitor energy next day

**Phase 3: Strength (Weeks 9+)**
- Resistance training 2-3x/week
- Interval training (short)
- Regular yoga practice
- Sports if tolerated
- Always listen to body

**Post-Exercise Protocol:**
- Shower immediately (rinse toxins)
- Hydrate with electrolytes
- Consider binder dose
- Infrared sauna if available
- Rest if needed

## Combining Modalities

### Synergistic Protocols

**Morning Stack:**
1. Nasal rinse
2. Infrared sauna (fasted)
3. Cold shower
4. Binders
5. Light breakfast

**Evening Stack:**
1. Gentle exercise
2. Epsom salt bath
3. Sleep supplements
4. Side sleeping position

**Weekly Rhythm:**
- Monday/Wednesday/Friday: Sauna
- Tuesday/Thursday: HBOT or ozone
- Daily: Nasal care, sleep optimization
- Weekend: Extra rest, gentle movement

## Investment Priorities

If budget is limited, prioritize in this order:

1. **Infrared sauna** (home unit ~$1000-5000)
2. **Quality sleep** (blackout curtains, supplements)
3. **Nasal care** supplies (~$50/month)
4. **HBOT** package (if neurological symptoms)
5. **Peptides** (if gut issues severe)
6. **Other therapies** as budget allows

  Always introduce one new modality at a time. Monitor your response for at least a week before adding another. Some therapies can mobilize significant toxins—ensure your drainage pathways are open and binders are in place.

## Next Steps

With supportive modalities in place, proceed to Module 08: Diet & Pantry to learn how nutrition can either support or sabotage your recovery.

Remember: These tools amplify your core protocol—they don't replace it.
