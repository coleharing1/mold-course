## Photo Identification Guide

### Size References
**Pin-head Size (1-2mm):**
- Early stage growth
- May appear as dark spots
- Easy to mistake for dirt

**Coin Size (1-2 inches):**
- Established colony
- Visible texture and color
- Clear identification possible

**Larger Patches (>3 inches):**
- Mature infestation
- Professional assessment needed
- May indicate structural damage

### Color Progression
**White â†’ Gray â†’ Dark:**
- Typical aging pattern for many molds
- Chaetomium follows this progression
- Indicates established growth

**Green â†’ Black:**
- Common in Aspergillus species
- May indicate moisture increase
- More dangerous when darker

**Pink/Red â†’ Brown:**
- Fusarium color progression
- Indicates continued growth
- Pink = early, brown = mature

## Testing and Confirmation

### When Visual ID Isn't Enough
- **Multiple species present**
- **Large affected areas**
- **Health symptoms correlate**
- **Insurance or legal requirements**
- **Pre-purchase property inspection**

### Professional Testing Methods
**Air Testing:**
- Spore count and identification
- Compares indoor/outdoor levels
- Good for general assessment

**Surface Testing:**
- Direct sampling of visible growth
- Tape lift or swab methods
- Confirms species identification

**Bulk Testing:**
- Material samples sent to lab
- Most accurate identification
- Required for legal cases

### DIY Testing Limitations
- **Cannot identify species accurately**
- **May miss hidden growth**
- **Results often misleading**
- **Cannot determine health risk levels**
