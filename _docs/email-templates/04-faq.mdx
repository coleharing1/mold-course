Hi {{name}},

Over the past few days, I've received dozens of replies to my emails.

The questions you're asking are the same ones I had (and that thousands of others have had).

Let me address the most common ones:

## "Is this approach safe?"

**Short answer:** Much safer than the alternatives I tried.

**Longer answer:** 
- CSM has been used safely for decades for cholesterol management
- Itraconazole is commonly prescribed for fungal infections
- Both are FDA-approved medications with known safety profiles
- We use liver monitoring protocols and specific dosing schedules
- The safety-gated progression prevents dangerous reactions

Compare this to unregulated supplements or ignoring the problem entirely.

## "What if my doctor won't prescribe these?"

This was my biggest fear too.

**The reality:** Most doctors will prescribe when you present the information correctly.

The course includes:
- Telehealth scripts (exact words to use)
- Lab results interpretation guides  
- Studies to share with skeptical doctors
- Alternative doctors database
- Insurance appeal letters

**Many students get prescriptions on their first telehealth appointment.**

## "Can't I just use natural alternatives?"

You can, and I include complete natural protocols in the course.

**However:**
- Natural binders are 25-75% as effective as CSM
- Recovery takes 2-3x longer typically  
- Some people plateau on natural protocols
- Fungal colonization often requires prescription antifungals

I always recommend starting with the most effective approach first.

## "How much does this cost?"

{{#if high_risk}}
{{name}}, I know cost is a concern, especially when you haven't been able to work at full capacity.

**Prescription costs (typical):**
- CSM: $50-150/month (often insurance covered)
- Itraconazole: $50-200/month 
- Lab testing: $300-600 total
- Supportive supplements: $75-100/month

**Total investment:** ~$1500-3000 for complete recovery

**Compare this to:**
- Continued medical appointments ($200+ each)
- Lost income from illness
- Ongoing supplement costs without results
- The cost of NOT recovering

Most people save money by recovering faster.

## "How long does recovery take?"

**My timeline:** 12 weeks to test negative, 6 months to feel completely normal

**Typical ranges:**
- 8-16 weeks for significant improvement
- 3-6 months for optimal recovery  
- Some people feel better in 2-4 weeks
- Complex cases may take 6-12 months

**The key is having a clear protocol to follow consistently.**

## "What if I have other health conditions?"

I had multiple diagnoses before discovering mold:
- "Fibromyalgia"  
- "Chronic fatigue syndrome"  
- "IBS"
- "Anxiety disorder"

**All resolved when I addressed the root cause.**

The course includes:
- Drug interaction checking  
- Modifications for common conditions
- Working with existing medications
- Coordination with other healthcare providers

## "Is this just another detox program?"

**No.** This is a medical protocol based on:
- Peer-reviewed research on mycotoxin removal
- Hospital protocols for toxin exposure  
- Functional medicine approaches to biotoxin illness
- Real clinical experience with thousands of patients

**It's not about cleanses, juice fasts, or unproven supplements.**

## Your Next Step

{{name}}, based on your quiz results ({{score}}/10), you have {{assessment_text}}.

## Tomorrow's Final Email

I'll share exactly what's included in the course and why this is your best chance to recover your health this year.

To your recovery,  
Kajsa

P.S. The most expensive mistake is waiting. Every day you delay proper treatment is another day of exposure and symptoms. Your health is worth the investment.
