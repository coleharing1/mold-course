# Finding Help Fast
*Connect with the right resources and support immediately*

## Find a Mold-Literate Doctor TODAY

Not all doctors understand mold illness. Many will dismiss your symptoms or suggest psychiatric treatment. You need someone who understands CIRS (Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome) and mycotoxin illness.

### Practitioner Directories

  title="Start Your Search Now"
  action="Visit these directories and search your area. Book the earliest available appointment, even if it's telehealth. You need medical documentation started immediately."

- **IFM.org** - Institute for Functional Medicine

**Search tips:**
- Filter by "environmental medicine"
- Look for "CIRS" or "biotoxin illness"

### What to Tell Your Current Doctor

If you must see a regular doctor first:

**Say this:**
"I've been exposed to water-damaged building materials and am experiencing multi-system symptoms consistent with CIRS/mycotoxin illness. I need testing for inflammatory markers and documentation for potential environmental illness."

**Bring:**
- Photos of mold/water damage
- Symptom diary
- This course printout
- Test requests (C4a, TGF-Î²1)
- ERMI/HERTSMI-2 results if available

**Avoid saying:**
- "I think I have toxic mold syndrome" (triggers dismissal)
- "I read online that..." (undermines credibility)
- "I'm allergic to mold" (different condition)
