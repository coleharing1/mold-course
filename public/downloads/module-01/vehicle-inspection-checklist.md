*This checklist is part of the Mold Detox Mastery course Module 01. Your vehicle is often the most overlooked source of daily mold exposure - don't let it sabotage your recovery efforts.*

**‚ö†Ô∏è SAFETY REMINDER:** When in doubt, seek professional assessment. Vehicle mold can be more concentrated and dangerous than home mold due to the confined space and direct exposure during driving.
