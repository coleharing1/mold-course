  <p className="font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-2">Module Summary in 50 Words:</p>
  <p className="text-blue-800">
    Test your environment with ERMI ($290) to find mold sources. Test your body with urine mycotoxin testing ($300-400) to measure toxic load. Both tests can be ordered directly online without a doctor. Retest after 3-6 months to track progress. Don't guess - testing is essential for proper treatment.

## Testing: Your Roadmap to Recovery

<TestingFlowchart />

Once you've identified potential mold exposure, testing confirms what you're dealing with. This module covers both **environmental testing** (mold in your space) and **medical testing** (mycotoxins in your body).

> **üí° Pro Tip:** Most people benefit from doing BOTH types of testing - environmental to find the source, medical to understand your body's toxic burden.

### Understanding Your Mycotoxin Results

Common mycotoxins and their sources:

| Mycotoxin | Common Source | Health Effects |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Aflatoxin** | Aspergillus | Liver damage, cancer risk |
| **Ochratoxin A** | Aspergillus, Penicillium | Kidney damage, immune suppression |
| **Trichothecenes** | Stachybotrys (black mold) | Severe neurotoxicity |
| **Gliotoxin** | Aspergillus | Immune suppression |
| **Citrinin** | Penicillium | Kidney toxicity |
| **Zearalenone** | Fusarium | Hormone disruption |

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Each mycotoxin requires different binders for removal. Your results determine your treatment protocol.

### VCS Test (Visual Contrast Sensitivity)
**Quick neurological screening**

- **Cost:** $10-15
- **Where:** vcstest.com
- **What it measures:** Ability to detect contrast (affected by neurotoxins)
- **Accuracy:** 92% sensitivity for biotoxin illness
- **Use for:** 
  - Initial screening
  - Progress tracking (retest every 3 months)
  - Quick check before expensive labs

### Blood Tests

#### Mold Antibody Panel
- **Tests:** IgE, IgG, IgA antibodies to molds
- **Cost:** $150-300
- **Shows:** Immune response to mold
- **Limitation:** Doesn't show mycotoxin levels

#### Inflammatory Markers
Important markers to check:
- C4a (complement)
- TGF-beta 1
- MMP-9
- MSH (melanocyte stimulating hormone)
- VIP (vasoactive intestinal peptide)
- VEGF

### Other Useful Tests

#### Organic Acids Test (OAT)
- **Cost:** $300-400
- **Shows:** Fungal colonization markers
- **Labs:** Great Plains, Genova

#### Nasal Swab Culture
- **Cost:** $100-200
- **Shows:** Fungal colonization in sinuses (MARCoNS)

## Where to Get Testing Done

### Order Tests Yourself
**Best option for most people**

1. **Mosaic Diagnostics** 
   - Direct order available
   - No doctor needed in most states
   - Clear results interpretation

2. **RealTime Labs**
   - Direct consumer ordering
   - Phone consultation available

### Through Practitioners

#### Functional Medicine Doctors
- Most familiar with mycotoxin testing
- Can interpret results
- Often expensive ($300-500 consult)

#### Naturopaths
- Usually knowledgeable about mold
- Can order all tests
- May offer treatment guidance

#### Regular MDs/Allergists
- May only offer allergy testing
- Often skeptical of mycotoxin illness
- Limited treatment knowledge

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Reality Check:** Most conventional doctors don't recognize mold illness beyond allergies. Be prepared to advocate for yourself or find a mold-literate practitioner.

### Telehealth Options
- **Push Health:** Get prescriptions after showing results
- **Rupa Health:** Order labs through their platform
- **Dr. Crista:** Mold specialist consultations

## Complete Cost Breakdown

<CostBreakdown />

## Your Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Start Here
1. **VCS Test** ($15) - Quick screening
2. **Urine Mycotoxin Test** ($300-400) - Essential for treatment
3. **ERMI or HERTSMI-2** ($200-350) - Find the source

### Priority 2: If Budget Allows
4. Inflammatory markers blood panel
5. Organic Acids Test
6. Professional home inspection

### Priority 3: Follow-Up Testing
- VCS every 3 months
- Urine mycotoxin at 6-7 months
- ERMI after remediation

## Interpreting Your Results

### Mycotoxin Levels
- **Low/Normal Range:** May still need treatment if symptomatic
- **Moderate:** Definite treatment needed
- **High:** Aggressive treatment protocol required

### What Your Results Mean for Treatment
Your mycotoxin types determine:
1. Which binders to use
2. Treatment duration
3. Additional support needed
4. Retesting schedule

## Documentation for Treatment

### Create Your Test Portfolio
- [ ] Environmental test results (ERMI/HERTSMI)
- [ ] Urine mycotoxin results
- [ ] VCS test screenshot
- [ ] Photos of visible mold
- [ ] Symptom timeline
- [ ] Previous medical records

### Why Documentation Matters
- Insurance claims
- Legal issues (landlord/workplace)
- Tracking progress
- Getting prescriptions
- Disability claims

## Action Steps

### This Week:
1. Order VCS test online ($15)
2. Choose mycotoxin lab (Mosaic or RealTime)
3. Order urine test kit
4. Schedule ERMI test

### Next Steps:
1. Complete all testing
2. Document results
3. Share with practitioner if working with one
4. Use results to guide treatment protocol

## Red Flags in Results

**Seek immediate medical attention if:**
- Trichothecenes (black mold toxins) are very high
- Multiple mycotoxins at extreme levels
- Severe neurological symptoms present
- Immune markers critically abnormal
