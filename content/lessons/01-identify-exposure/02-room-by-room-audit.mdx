# Room-by-Room Home Audit
*Systematic approach to checking every space*

<EvidenceBadge level="solid" />

## The Professional Inspector Method

Home inspectors follow a specific protocol to ensure nothing is missed. This systematic approach will help you identify ALL potential mold sources in your living space.

<SafetyFlag 
  type="critical"
  message="Before starting: Ensure you have proper protective equipment (N95 mask, gloves, flashlight). If you find extensive mold (>10 sq ft), stop inspection and contact professionals."
/>

## Understanding Water Migration

### **How Water Moves Through Homes**
Water doesn't just stay where it first appears. It:
- Travels along wooden joists and studs
- Seeps behind walls through small cracks
- Migrates upward through capillary action
- Moves horizontally through concrete
- Follows gravity to lowest points

### **The 24-48 Hour Rule**
Mold can begin growing within 24-48 hours of water exposure. By the time you see it, the problem has likely been developing for weeks or months.

## Room-by-Room Inspection Protocol

### üöø **Bathrooms (Highest Risk)**

Bathrooms account for 60% of home mold issues due to constant moisture and poor ventilation.

#### **Critical Areas to Check:**

**Shower/Tub Area:**
- [ ] Grout lines (especially floor corners)
- [ ] Caulking around tub and shower
- [ ] Shower curtain and liner
- [ ] Behind shampoo bottles and fixtures
- [ ] Ceiling above shower (check for stains)
- [ ] Wall behind shower head

**Under Sink:**
- [ ] Cabinet floor for water damage
- [ ] Pipe connections for leaks
- [ ] Back wall of cabinet
- [ ] Around shut-off valves
- [ ] P-trap connections

**Toilet Area:**
- [ ] Base of toilet (wax ring leaks)
- [ ] Behind toilet tank
- [ ] Floor around toilet
- [ ] Wall behind toilet
- [ ] Supply line connections

**Ventilation:**
- [ ] Exhaust fan grates (remove if possible)
- [ ] Ductwork connections
- [ ] Window sills if windows present
- [ ] Mirror edges (condensation)

<DoThisNow 
  title="Test Your Bathroom Right Now"
  action="Use your smartphone flashlight to check behind your toilet and under your bathroom sink. Look for water stains, discoloration, or any musty smells. This is where most people find their first mold."
  urgency="high"
  timeframe="Next 5 minutes"

- [ ] Corners with poor air circulation
- [ ] Anywhere items touch exterior walls
- [ ] Old furniture against walls

**Moisture Sources:**
- [ ] Dehumidifier collection area
- [ ] Laundry room (especially behind washer/dryer)
- [ ] Any previous flooding areas
- [ ] Condensation on pipes or ducts

### üèõÔ∏è **Attic (Often Overlooked)**

Attics show signs of roof leaks and poor ventilation issues.

#### **Critical Areas to Check:**

**Roof Issues:**
- [ ] Dark stains on roof decking
- [ ] Wet or discolored insulation
- [ ] Around chimneys and vents
- [ ] Roof valleys and corners
- [ ] Daylight visible through roof

**Ventilation:**
- [ ] Soffit vents (blocked?)
- [ ] Ridge vents (adequate?)
- [ ] Exhaust fans (bathroom/kitchen)
- [ ] HVAC ductwork
- [ ] Condensation on metal surfaces

### üõèÔ∏è **Bedrooms**

Bedrooms can have hidden mold affecting sleep quality and health.

#### **Critical Areas to Check:**

**Windows:**
- [ ] Window sills and frames
- [ ] Condensation between glass panes
- [ ] Around window AC units
- [ ] Curtains and blinds
- [ ] Wall below windows

**Closets:**
- [ ] Corners and back walls
- [ ] Behind hanging clothes
- [ ] Floor areas
- [ ] Upper shelves
- [ ] Shoes and storage boxes

**Furniture:**
- [ ] Behind beds against exterior walls
- [ ] Under mattresses (especially memory foam)
- [ ] Behind dressers and nightstands
- [ ] Around humidifiers or plants

### üõãÔ∏è **Living Areas**
